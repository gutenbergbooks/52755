<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>A SQUAD-ROOM MISUNDERSTANDING</small></h2>

<p><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap2">"</span>I</span> SEE by the paper&mdash;&mdash;" began Private
Green, looking up.</p>

<p>Instantly the doughboys in the squad
room turned loose on him.</p>

<p>"You can never believe what you read in
the papers," broke in Private Hyman.</p>

<p>"Cut it and study your guard manual!" yelled
another.</p>

<p>"Is it going to rain to-night, rookie?"</p>

<p>"Let him alone. He wants to prove that he
can read," jeered another, which witticism
brought a swift flush to the face of Private
Green.</p>

<p>For Green was as verdant as his name. He
was a new recruit, just in after his probationary
period at a northwestern recruit rendezvous.
He was so green, in fact, that the men in the
squad room, and throughout B Company of
the Thirty-fourth United States Infantry accused
the young fellow of having joined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Army so that he could get a wall of bayonets
between his own inexperienced self and the
bunco men.</p>

<p>The young recruit's mistake lay in pretending
to know a lot more than he really did know. He
had been put through the unmerciful hazing that
always awaits a very "fresh" rookie, or recruit,
but even that had taught him little. Private
Green was always looking for the chance to
prove to his new comrades among the regulars
of the Thirty-fourth that he knew something
after all. This afternoon his trouble had taken
the form of trying to find something in a two-days'
old newspaper on which he could discourse
for the enlightenment of the other men.</p>

<p>"I see by the paper," continued Private William
Green, as soon as his tormentors would
let him proceed, "that we of the United States
are now manufacturing the biggest and finest
guns in the world."</p>

<p>"Meaning cannon?" quizzed Private Hyman
innocently.</p>

<p>"Sure," nodded Private William Green.</p>

<p>"Take that over to the red sheds," jeered
one soldier.</p>

<p>"What do we of the infantry care about the
red legs and their troubles?" demanded Hyman,
as though affronted.</p>

<p>For the "doughboys," or infantrymen, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
regular Army, affect supreme scorn for all other
arms of the service. In especial do they profess
contempt for the artillerymen, or red legs, this
latter epithet being derived from the fact that
red is the artillery color, and that the officers
and non-commissioned officers of the artillery
wear red side stripes on their trousers.</p>

<p>"But think what it means to this country,"
insisted Private William Green,"when we manufacture
the biggest guns in the world."</p>

<p>"And we have also the loudest-mouthed and
noisiest members in the peace societies," remarked
Private Hal Overton, laughingly.</p>

<p>"What have peace-spouters got to do with big
guns?" demanded Private William Green rather
stiffly.</p>

<p>"Why, you see," explained Hal,"the peace
advocates look for the millennium."</p>

<p>"The mill&mdash;what kind of mill?" inquired
Green, with unlooked-for interest, for Private
Willie had been employed in a grist mill before
enlisting.</p>

<p>"The mil-len-nium," explained Private Overton
patiently, though with a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Never heard of that mill," replied Private
Green rather disdainfully. "What's it for?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, Greenie&mdash;pardon me, I mean
Willie," continued Hal Overton, while the other
soldiers in the squad room, scenting fun, remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
silent, "it's like this: The millennium is
the age that may come some time. The peace-spouters
tell us that the millennium is coming in
two weeks from autumn. That millennium is the
age when all war will be abolished and soldiers
will have to go to work."</p>

<p>"What's all that got to do with what I was
talking about?" demanded Private Green, bewildered
and half offended.</p>

<p>"Wait, and Overton will tell you," warned
Hal's chum, Noll Terry, who stood by looking
decidedly trim and handsome in his spotless
khaki uniform.</p>

<p>"Of course you know all about Armageddon?"
resumed Hal.</p>

<p>"Never heard of him," retorted Green suspiciously,
for he saw the amused looks in the
faces of some of the soldiers standing about.
"Say&mdash;hold on! Is Army-gid-ap&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Armageddon," corrected Hal quietly.</p>

<p>"Is that the name of the new breakfast food
that the rainmaker (Army surgeon) was trying
to have sprung on the bill of fare of our company
mess?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Hal assured him. "Nothing as
bad as that. You see, Greenie&mdash;Willie, I mean&mdash;while
the peace-howlers lay all of their bets on
the millennium being just over the fence, there's
another crowd of high-brow thinkers who look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
forward to the great battle when all the armies
of the world will be present. That battle is
going to be the one grand fight of all history,
and the armies of one half of the world are
going to get a sure thrashing from the armies
of the other half. Any way you look at it, it's
surely going to be a big scrap, Willie, and after
that maybe all soldiers will be too tired to fight
any more. Now, for that great battle the high-brows
have invented the name of Armageddon.
Don't forget the name, Willie&mdash;Armageddon.
It's going to be the biggest fight the world ever
saw&mdash;the only real fight in history, as we'll look
back at it afterwards."</p>

<p>"But what has all this got to do with what
I was reading from the paper?" insisted Private
Green.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you see, if we're making the biggest
and finest guns, and Armageddon comes
on, it'll be just like robbing a baker's wagon for
us to win Armageddon. On the other hand, if
millennium runs in first, and we don't need the
guns, then we win, too. We've got the biggest
guns for Armageddon, and the noisiest peace-howlers
for the millennium. Armageddon or millennium,
it's just as good a bet either way, for
the United States is bound to win, going or coming."</p>

<p>Private William Green didn't see more than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
tenth part of the point, but the laugh that followed
got on his nerves.</p>

<p>"You fellows are nothing but a lot of horse-play
idiots," he growled, rising and stalking
away.</p>

<p>As he made his way through the little fringe
of soldiers something happened to Private William
Green, but Hal Overton was the only disinterested
person who happened to see it.</p>

<p>William had joined the Army after toiling and
saving for some four years. Green had saved
his money, and hoped to save a lot more. He
was known to have about four hundred dollars
in cash, which he had so far declined to deposit
with the Army pay-master. Where he kept this
money was not known, beyond the fact that he
sometimes carried it on his person.</p>

<p>Just as William was passing through the group
of soldiers a hand ran expertly up under the
loose hem of Private Green's blouse. A wallet
left Green's right-hand hip pocket, coming away
with the intruding hand. Then Private Dowley
slipped the wallet into his own trousers'
pocket.</p>

<p>Hal saw and acted with his usual quickness.</p>

<p>"Don't do that, Dowley," Hal advised, moving
forward and resting a hand on Private Dowley's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Don't do what?" demanded Dowley, turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
scowling eyes on Hal.</p>

<p>"Give him back his wallet, Dowley. That's
carrying a joke too far."</p>

<p>"I haven't&mdash;&mdash;" was as far as Private Dowley
got when Private William Green, who was
twenty-two years old, tall, raw-boned, freckled
and sandy haired, heard the word and clapped
a hand to his own hip pocket.</p>

<p>"I've been touched&mdash;robbed&mdash;right in the
heart of United States forces!" yelled Private
Green, turning and staggering back.</p>

<p>"Give it back to him, Dowley," urged Hal.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? To say that I&mdash;&mdash;"
sputtered Dowley, clenching his fists as though
he meant to hurl himself at Hal Overton.</p>

<p>But Private William himself settled the problem
by hurling himself weakly at Dowley and
running his hands over his comrade's clothing.</p>

<p>"There it is," yelled William. "My wallet&mdash;right
in Dowley's trousers' pocket."</p>

<p>"Of course," nodded Private Hal. "Dowley
did it as a joke, but it looks like carrying a joke
too far."</p>

<p>Dowley, seeing that further denial was useless,
broke into a guffaw. Then he thrust a hand
into his pocket, producing the wallet. William
Green pounced upon it with an exclamation of
joy.</p>

<p>"I wanted to string Greenie," explained Dowley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
hoarsely, "but Overton had to go to work
and spoil it all."</p>

<p>"The joke was in bad taste," observed Private
Hyman quietly. "We don't want any work
of that sort here, even for fun."</p>

<p>"What I marvel at," remarked Hal innocently,
"is how you did the thing in such a
smooth, light-fingered way, Dowley."</p>

<p>"Light fingered? You hound!" raged Dowley,
his eyes blazing. "Do you mean that I
did the trick with the skill of a crook?"</p>

<p>He placed himself squarely before the young
soldier, crowding him back and glaring into
Overton's eyes.</p>

<p>The other soldiers in the room found suddenly
a new interest in the scene. Young Overton
wasn't quarrelsome; he was the soul of good
nature, in fact, but he knew how to fight when
he had to do it.</p>

<p>"Stop walking on my feet," counseled Hal,
giving Dowley a slight push that sent him backward
a step.</p>

<p>"What did you mean?" insisted Dowley, who
was working himself into a greater rage with
every second.</p>

<p>"It's time to ask what you mean," retorted
Hal.</p>

<p>"You called me a light-fingered crook, because
I played a joke on Greenie," roared Dowley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
"And I'm going to make you eat talk like that."</p>

<p>"You're putting a wrong construction on my
words," returned Hal quietly.</p>

<p>"You called me a light-fingered crook, didn't
you?" demanded Dowley hotly.</p>

<p>"I spoke of your performance as a light-fingered
trick."</p>

<p>"That's the same thing," raged the older man.</p>

<p>"Is it?"</p>

<p>"Don't play baby, and don't crawfish,"
sneered Dowley, scowling. "You know what
you meant."</p>

<p>"And you seem to think you know, too."</p>

<p>"We must break this up," whispered Private
Hyman to Noll Terry, Hal Overton's soldier
chum. "I don't want to see him get hurt."</p>

<p>"What do you care about Dowley?" asked
Noll, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Dowley be hanged!" retorted Hyman. "It's
your kid friend I'm thinking about."</p>

<p>"Oh, he won't get hurt," retorted Noll with
cheery assurance.</p>

<p>"Your friend is pretty handy with his fists, I
know, but Dowley is a big fellow, an older man,
with more fighting judgment; and I miss my
guess if Dowley hasn't had a big lot of practice
in rough-and-tumble in all the bad spots of
life."</p>

<p>"Will you take back and apologize for what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
you said?" insisted Dowley.</p>

<p>"If I said anything I shouldn't have said,"
replied Hal quietly.</p>

<p>"You're a liar, a cur and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop that!" objected Hal Overton, yet without
raising his voice.</p>

<p>"Apologize, then! Do it handsomely, too."</p>

<p>"You've said too much to be entitled to any
apology now," Hal assured the scowling soldier.</p>

<p>"Apologize, or I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Going to start now?" Hal queried smilingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dowley made a rush, with both fists clenched.
Hal nimbly sidestepped, putting up his own
guard at the same time.</p>

<p>"Attention!" shouted a soldier.</p>

<p>Instantly both prospective combatants
dropped their hands. The door of the squad-room
had opened, and now there entered a
young officer, handsome and resplendent in his
new fatigue uniform. Unlike the khaki-clad
enlisted men, this officer was attired in the blue
uniform. Down the outer side of either leg of
his trousers ran the broad white stripe of the
commissioned officer of infantry. On his shoulders
lay the plain shoulder strap, without bars
or other device, proclaiming the young man to
be a second lieutenant. He was a handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
young fellow of twenty-two, erect, fine of bearing
and every inch of him an intense soldier.</p>

<p>"Where is Sergeant Hupner?" asked Lieutenant
Prescott. His glance, as he made the
inquiry, appeared to be directed to Private Hal
Overton.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir," Hal answered respectfully.</p>

<p>"And neither of the corporals berthed in this
squad room are present, either?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>No displeasure was apparent in the young
lieutenant's tone. There was no reason why
the corporals, as well as the sergeant, should
not be absent at this moment, if they chose.
The officer's query was made only for the purpose
of securing information.</p>

<p>"You are Private Overton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"When Sergeant Hupner returns be good
enough to say to him that I wish to see him at
my quarters. Any time before the call for parade
will do."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"If Private Overton is not here when Sergeant
Hupner returns, any other man may deliver
my message," continued Lieutenant Prescott.
"That is all. Good afternoon, men."</p>

<p>The young lieutenant turned and strode from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the squad room.</p>

<p>"Somehow," mused Private Hyman, "it takes
West Point to turn out a real soldier, doesn't
it? No matter how good a man is, or how long
he spends in learning the soldier trade, he's
never quite the same unless he has the West
Point brand on him."</p>

<p>"That's nothing to do with my affair,"
growled Private Dowley. "Now, Kid Overton,
I'll attend to your case."</p>

<p>"Oh, cut it, Dowley," grumbled Private Hyman.
"Get out and keep out, or we'll find a
blanket and give you a little excitement. Eh,
boys?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to polish off this kid for his insults
to me," insisted Dowley sulkily.</p>

<p>"Bring the blanket, boys," muttered Hyman
wearily.</p>

<p>From several of the men came a gleeful whoop
as they started in various directions. It looked
like business of a different sort now, and Dowley
was not too blind to see it.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right, if you're all going to butt in
to save this kid doughbaby from his just deserts.
But he'll get his later on," snarled Private
Dowley.</p>

<p>"I'm all ready now. There's no time like
the present," smiled Hal.</p>

<p>But two of the soldiers were coming back with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
blankets. There's not an atom of fun&mdash;for the
victim&mdash;in being tossed in a blanket, so Dowley
started for the door.</p>

<p>It banged behind him. Two minutes later
it banged again, this time closing on big Private
Bill Hooper.</p>

<p>"Birds of a feather&mdash;you all know the rest,"
chuckled Private Hyman, winking at some of
his comrades in B Company. A general laugh
answered.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you let Dowley have his fun?"
asked Private Hal Overton good-humoredly.</p>

<p>"Because, Hal," replied Hyman, "Dowley
is a big, ugly, dangerous man. You're spunky;
you're all grit, and I don't know any kid who
can handle himself as well as you do. But Dowley
is in another class."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"You'll do well, after this, Hal," murmured
Noll Terry, when the chums were by themselves
at one end of the room, "to keep your eyes open.
I shall do the same."</p>

<p>"Why?" Overton wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Well, you've made an enemy of Dowley."</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"Don't treat it as lightly as that," warned
Noll Terry with great earnestness. "Dowley
isn't a man to forget even a fancied injury. You
noticed that Bill Hooper went out soon after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Dowley, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but what of it?"</p>

<p>"Hooper hates you; he has hated you for
a long time, and Dowley has just learned to
hate you. Now, you may be sure those two birds
of a feather will flock together."</p>

<p>"Let 'em," laughed Hal indifferently.</p>

<p>"For what purpose will they flock together?"
persisted Noll. "They now have a common interest
in making life miserable for you."</p>

<p>"Just for my one remark to Dowley?" smiled
Hal.</p>

<p>"I tell you Dowley is the kind of man who
takes offense easily, and then can't make himself
forget. Look there, quick!"</p>

<p>Noll, who had been half facing one of the end
windows of the squad room, suddenly nudged
Hal, then pointed.</p>

<p>"Do you see that pair over yonder, just
going through under the trees?" queried Noll
Terry dryly.</p>

<p>"Hooper and Dowley," nodded Hal.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose has brought that pair
together so quickly after the scene here?
They're drawn together by a common interest&mdash;in
you."</p>

<p>"Let 'em talk about me, if they like," proposed
Hal coolly.</p>

<p>"Do you imagine they're getting together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
just to talk about you?" demanded Private
Terry half indignantly. "Wake up, Hal; keep
your eyes open, and I'll do the same. They're
two, but we are two, also. If you don't go to
sleep, Hal, I think we can prove ourselves equal
to anything that that pair may try to do. But
you don't want to forget that they are certainly
plotting to do something to get you into trouble.
Whatever gets you into trouble also puts a bad
mark on your record as a soldier and threatens
to interfere with your promotion."</p>

<p>"If Hooper and Dowley get busy along those
lines," muttered Hal, his eyes blazing, "they'll
find that they have a sure fight on their hands."</p>

<p>"That's the way to talk, old fellow," approved
Noll Terry, his eyes shining eagerly.
"And don't think I'm foolish, either, in the
warning that I'm giving you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Noll; I guess it will be as well
to be ordinarily alert, where that pair are concerned.
It never does any fellow harm to have
his eyes open at all times."</p>

<p>Readers of the previous volume in this series,
"<span class="smcap">Uncle Sam's Boys in the Ranks</span>," will need
no introduction to Privates Hal Overton and
Noll Terry, of the Thirty-fourth United States
Infantry, stationed at Fort Clowdry, in the
lower Rockies of Colorado.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll were bright, typical American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
boys when, at the age of eighteen, back in their
New Jersey home town, they decided that their
careers in life were to be found through enlisting
in the Army.</p>

<p>It was in April that they enlisted, after which
they were sent to a recruit rendezvous near New
York City. At the recruit rendezvous the two
young "rookies," as recruits are commonly
termed in the service, were whipped very
thoroughly into shape.</p>

<p>While at the recruit rendezvous the two rookies
distinguished themselves by preventing the
desertion of a corporal who was in arrest. For
this service they were commended in orders.</p>

<p>On the way to their regiment in Colorado the
boys were present when an attempt was made
to hold up the United States mail train. An
Army officer, Major Davis, of the Seventeenth
Cavalry, ordered them to assist him in resisting
an attack on the mail car. In the encounter that
followed some of the train robbers were shot,
others then surrendering to Major Davis. That
same night Major Davis wired the colonel of
the Thirty-fourth, speaking of the young recruits
in high terms for their prompt obedience
and their grit under trying circumstances. So
Overton and Terry, on joining their regiment the
next morning, found themselves in high favor.</p>

<p>Of course the young soldiers had to endure
the usual amount of "hazing" when they took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
up their new life in the squad room. But this
they did with a combination of grit and good
humor that soon won them the respect of the
older soldiers.</p>

<p>Then came a period of great excitement on
the post. Despite the fact that an entire battalion
of the Thirty-fourth was stationed at Fort
Clowdry, a gang of burglars visited the quarters
of married officers on dark nights, and invariably
succeeded in getting away with substantial booty.</p>

<p>It was young Private Overton who, when on
sentry duty up in officers' row, was first to detect
the burglars as they were leaving a house
that they had robbed. Before the guard arrived
Private Hal Overton had a spirited battle with
the decamping thieves. One of them turned out
to be Tip Branders, a young bully who had once
lived in the home town of Hal and Noll. Branders
had robbed his own mother and had drifted
west, falling in with bad company. Hal and
Noll then remembered a rock-strewn, distant
part of the post where they had once met Tip,
and there they led a squad of soldiers, under
an officer. Here, after another brief but spirited
battle, the escaped burglars had been caught;
and here also all the booty stolen from the quarters
along officers' row was recovered.</p>

<p>Both young soldiers had now received great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
credit for their daring and clever work. Moreover,
both had gone on rapidly in the thorough
learning of their new work as soldiers of the
regular Army.</p>

<p>And now the month of August had come
around. Both young soldiers were now on the
high road to efficiency and success in their
strenuous new life.</p>

<p>Readers of the "<span class="smcap">High School Boys' Series</span>"
and the "<span class="smcap">West Point Series</span>" will be quick to
recognize another young man who has been
briefly introduced in the opening of this present
volume&mdash;Lieutenant Dick Prescott, a graduate
of the United States Military Academy at West
Point, and just recently appointed to his
regiment, the Thirty-fourth. With Lieutenant
Prescott was Lieutenant Greg Holmes,
who will be remembered as Prescott's close
chum in the High School and West Point
days.</p>

<p>Prescott we now find as second lieutenant of
B Company; Holmes was now second lieutenant
of C Company of the same battalion of the
Thirty-fourth.</p>

<p>Both were splendid young officers, and manly
to the core. In the few days that Lieutenants
Prescott and Holmes had been at Fort Clowdry
they had made a fine impression on the enlisted
men. Soldiers are quick to judge and estimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the worth of their officers.</p>

<p>Sergeant Hupner soon entered the squad
room. The first sergeant being absent for a
couple of days, Hupner was acting first sergeant.
To him Hal gave Lieutenant Prescott's message.</p>

<p>"I'll go up to the lieutenant's quarters at
once," nodded Hupner. "He's a fine young
officer, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Private Overton. "But I
haven't yet met any but mighty fine officers in
the service, so the lieutenant isn't any cause of
surprise to me."</p>

<p>Hupner was back within twenty minutes.</p>

<p>"Attention," he called. "Men, in the absence
of the captain and first lieutenant until Wednesday,
Lieutenant Prescott is company commander.
He has just notified me, as acting first
sergeant, to inform the men that B and C Companies
march from the post on Friday for a
two weeks' period of training in field duty.
Every man will promptly see to it that all his
field outfit is in proper order. Any man wishing
further instruction or advice will apply to
me at any time up to our departure."</p>

<p>Then Sergeant Hupner hurried forth to acquaint
the men in the other squad rooms of B
Company with the news.</p>

<p>"Field work? Hurrah!" shouted Private
Terry, always eager to experience new phases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of the soldier's life.</p>

<p>"You've never been off on field work, have
you?" asked Hyman dryly.</p>

<p>"No; that's why I'm so pleased about it,"
Noll answered.</p>

<p>"And that's the only reason," added Hyman.
"Take it from me that it's a period of hard
work, tedious marching, blistered feet, aching
muscles and all but crumbling bones. It's nothing
but a big, torturesome hike through the
mountains."</p>

<p>"I'll enjoy it," insisted Private Terry.</p>

<p>"Wait," advised Hyman.</p>

<p>Soon after the buglers of the post were sounding
first call to afternoon parade. It was not
until the men were falling in ranks that Bill
Hooper and the morose Dowley heard about the
coming tour of field duty.</p>

<p>"That will be our chance," muttered Hooper
to Dowley, after the men had been dismissed at
the conclusion of parade. The two were again
by themselves, their scheming heads together.</p>

<p>"I don't believe the chance will be as good
off in the field as it will be here at barracks,"
grunted Dowley.</p>

<p>"That's because you haven't been in the Army
long enough to know," retorted big Bill Hooper.</p>

<p>"Blast the Army!" snarled Dowley.</p>

<p>"However did you come to enlist, anyway?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
asked Hooper curiously.</p>

<p>"I had reasons of my own," replied Dowley
shortly.</p>

<p>"Did the sheriff have anything to do with
those reasons?" grinned Hooper darkly.</p>

<p>"Don't get too curious!" warned the other.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not nosey," laughed Hooper. "And
we can't afford to quarrel. We're both pledged
to getting Overton kicked out of the service."</p>

<p>"Are you sure that he and Terry really expect
to work their way up to becoming commissioned
officers?"</p>

<p>"I have it on the best of authority," declared
Private Hooper.</p>

<p>"Whose?"</p>

<p>"Their own."</p>

<p>"Did they tell you so?"</p>

<p>"Not they! Those kids are too close-mouthed
for that. At least, they didn't tell me direct,
and I don't believe they've told any other enlisted
men on the post. But I heard them talking
it over, one day when they didn't know I
was around. They expect to be made corporals
before their first year is out. In three years
they hope to be sergeants, and then they scheme
to take the enlisted men's examination for commissions
as second lieutenants."</p>

<p>"Lieutenants? Shave-tails?" guffawed Dowley.
"Hooper, they'll never even be corporals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
It's a bob-tail discharge for theirs!"</p>

<p>Second lieutenants, when their commissions
are very new, are often referred to as "shave-tails."
A "bob-tail" is a dishonorable discharge,
after court-martial. To a real soldier
a "bob-tail" means unspeakable disgrace.</p>

<p>"A bob-tail for theirs&mdash;yes, sir," repeated
Private Dowley. "And I'm genius enough to
bring it about!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you won't need my help, for you
sure are some smart," suggested Bill Hooper in
a tone of pretended admiration.</p>

<p>"I'm smart enough to see that you'd drop
out and use me as the catspaw," growled Private
Dowley. "None of that, Bill! You'll stand
right by and do half of the dirty work in exchange
for half of the satisfaction. Between us
we'll give that fool Overton a new middle name,
and that middle name will be 'Bob-tail'!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>ON THE GREAT SUMMER HIKE</small></h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>ROM up the mountain road one of a little
group of officers ahead sent back an informal
signal.</p>

<p>"B Company fall in!" called out Lieutenant
Dick Prescott.</p>

<p>"C Company fall in!" followed Lieutenant
Greg Holmes.</p>

<p>These two young West Pointers had been left
temporarily in command of the companies with
which they served.</p>

<p>Some hundred and eighty men rose from their
by no means soft seats on the ground along
the trail and fell into single file.</p>

<p>Another hand signal came down the trail.</p>

<p>"B Company forward, route step, march!"
commanded Lieutenant Prescott.</p>

<p>"C Company forward, route step, march,"
echoed Lieutenant Holmes a moment later.</p>

<p>Tortuously the line moved forward once more.
To one well up in the air that long line might
have looked like a thin serpent trailing its way
up the mountain side. But it was a very real,
human line.</p>

<p>Each private soldier carried rifle, bayonet,
cartridge belt, intrenching tool, canteen, haversack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and blanket roll. It was a heavy pack.
In addition, men here and there carried either
a pick or a shovel.</p>

<p>Noll was carrying an extra shovel just now.
Hal Overton had no such extra pack to-day,
but all the day before he had toiled along with
a pick added to the rest of his equipment.</p>

<p>What have soldiers to do with a pick and
shovel? Theoretically these two companies now
engaged on field duty were marching through a
hostile country. After a battle the pick and
shovel may be used for the work of burying
slain comrades. Such tools are also useful
in the swift digging of trenches in which to fight.</p>

<p>It was past the middle of the afternoon now,
and the day of the week Monday. This little
column was winding up the third day of its work
in field.</p>

<p>As B Company traveled tediously along, Hal
Overton was nineteenth man from the first
sergeant. Noll was twentieth; directly behind
Terry marched Private Hyman.</p>

<p>"Terry?" called Hyman in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Yes?" returned Noll.</p>

<p>"How do you like field work now?"</p>

<p>"Fine."</p>

<p>"You're a cheerful liar," growled Private
Hyman.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," laughed Noll. "I'm telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the truth."</p>

<p>"You really enjoy this hike?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and so does Hal."</p>

<p>"Huh! He's a bigger liar than you are."</p>

<p>"What's that human calamity behind you
howling about?" demanded Private Overton.</p>

<p>"He's intimating that the truth isn't in us
because we claim to like field duty."</p>

<p>"Hyman always was a bake-house soldier,"
laughed Hal cheerily.</p>

<p>"What's that kid saying about me?" demanded
Hyman.</p>

<p>"Overton says," reported Noll, not very accurately,
"that he can't understand why you're
in the Army at all. He says that one of your
temperament could find a job in civil life that
would suit you much better."</p>

<p>"What job is that?" asked Hyman.</p>

<p>"Nurse girl," grinned Terry.</p>

<p>"For that," threatened Hyman, "I'll put salt
in that kid's coffee to-night."</p>

<p>The conversation was carried on in a low
tone of course. Troops in the field, marching at
route step, are allowed to carry on quiet conversations
when not supposed to be near the
enemy.</p>

<p>"You want to look out for Hyman, Hal," Noll
passed word forward.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"He says you stole his bacon from his haversack
this morning and he's going to set a steel
trap in his haversack to-night."</p>

<p>"Hyman doesn't know the truth when he halts
it on sentry post," Overton retorted. "Hyman
hasn't had any bacon in his haversack since we
started from Fort Clowdry."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" demanded Private Hyman,
who happened to overhear this statement.</p>

<p>"Because I've gotten up every night and
looked through your haversack for bacon," declared
Private Overton unblushingly.</p>

<p>"I heard to-day why you joined the Army,"
grunted Hyman.</p>

<p>"Yes?" grinned Hal.</p>

<p>"Sure! You had some trouble with the sheriff
at home over stealing the flowers from the cemetery
and selling them to get cigarette money.
You're a nice one, Overton, to be entrusted with
government property!"</p>

<p>"Oh, come, now, Hyman," Hal laughed back.
"That wasn't so bad as your case. You enlisted
because the judge said you'd either have to go
to jail for robbing the Salvation Army's Christmas
boxes, or else turn soldier."</p>

<p>Half a dozen men in the long line were laughing
now.</p>

<p>"I'll fix you for that when you're asleep to-night,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
growled Hyman.</p>

<p>"Yes; I notice you never do anything to a
fellow when he's awake," jeered Private Hal.</p>

<p>The two men were not on bad terms, nor in
any danger of becoming so. This was merely
an instance of the way soldiers "josh" one
another.</p>

<p>The sun was now disappearing behind the
western hill tops. It would be daylight, however,
for more than two hours to come.</p>

<p>Fifty minutes after this last start Lieutenant
Prescott again received a hand signal from the
officers on ahead.</p>

<p>"B Company halt; fall out," ordered the
young West Pointer.</p>

<p>Holmes repeated the command to C Company.</p>

<p>The head of the line had halted near a grove
through which a brook bubbled along on its way
to the stream down in the canyon to the right
of the trail.</p>

<p>"The officers are going to inspect the grove
as a site for camp," was the word that passed
back along the line.</p>

<p>"A soldier's first duty," quoth Hal, as he sank
upon the ground, "is to make himself as comfortable
as he can."</p>

<p>Noll, too, dropped to the ground, and Hyman
followed the example.</p>

<p>"Overton, I'll have to borrow some of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
baby powder of yours to-night," sighed Hyman.</p>

<p>"For your complexion?" grinned Hal.</p>

<p>"No; to put in my shoes. This mountain
hike has my feet in bad."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what you ought to do, just before
every big hike," laughed Hal.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me anything about the hospital,"
murmured Hyman disgustedly. "I tried that,
day before we left Fort Clowdry, but the rainmaker
warned me that if I tried to make hospital
report, he'd see to it that I was left on thin gruel
diet for a month."</p>

<p>"The rainmaker knew his business," mocked
Hal. "And I've heard another yarn about that
rainmaker."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"After a malingerer gets his thin gruel down
the rainmaker gives him a stiff dose of syrup
of ipecac, and the gruel comes up again."</p>

<p>"There's no show for a man in the Army nowadays,"
sighed Hyman, who, with all his pretense
at "kicking," was a keen soldier and dependable
man.</p>

<p>In every regiment are some soldiers who would
shirk every arduous duty if it were possible.
The favorite device, with such men, is to turn
malingerer&mdash;that is, to pretend illness and gain
admission to hospital, which means a solid rest
while comrades are working hard. But the successes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of malingerers in the way of shirking have
made Army surgeons keener, also. Lucky is the
suspected malingerer who doesn't get put on
thin diet and fed nauseating medicines.</p>

<p>From the group of officers ahead on the trail
came Captain Freeman and First Lieutenant
Ray of C Company.</p>

<p>"Mr. Holmes," called Captain Freeman, "let
C Company fall in and take up the march
again."</p>

<p>Young Lieutenant Holmes instantly gave the
order to fall in. A moment later C Company
moved off at the route step.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" Hal asked Hyman.</p>

<p>"Oh, some new scheme that the officers have
hatched up," replied Hyman. "There'll probably
be a sham engagement on between C and
our company to-morrow."</p>

<p>"We're lucky if it doesn't take place in the
night," grunted another soldier.</p>

<p>"Well, my man, suppose it does?" demanded
Sergeant Hupner, appearing behind the
"kicker." "What do you suppose these
man&oelig;uvres are for? They're to teach you the
soldier's trade. They're to fit you so that, in
actual war, you'll know what to do under any
given conditions. The better you know your
trade, in war, the better chances you have to
come out of the war alive. This field duty, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
so many of you dislike, is for the training of
every officer and man in the very things he does
in war time. The better every officer and man
understands them the better is each fellow's
chance of keeping alive in war time. Those of
you who grumble ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
Look around you at some of the older
soldiers who've seen service, and you'll find they
never kick."</p>

<p>"B Company fall in!" rang the order, this
time from Captain Cortland.</p>

<p>But the march was to be a short one. The
command was led into the grove and halted. The
order to pitch camp was given. Now a lively
scene followed.</p>

<p>As the outer covering of his blanket roll each
soldier carries a flap of canvas, which constitutes
one half of a shelter tent, as it is officially
termed. The soldier's name for it is dog tent
or pup house. Each man also carries two
jointed sticks. One pair of sticks is jointed to
form the front pole of the tent, the other the
rear pole. In front of the tent site a peg is
driven, and a cord passed from this peg up over
the front pole, across to the rear pole, and down
to a peg at the rear. Now the two flaps of canvas
are fitted over this frame and the tent is up.</p>

<p>"Let's beat the company to it, Noll?"
breathed Hal in his bunkie's ear. In the Army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the "bunkie" is the man with whom the tent
is shared. Usually two bunkies become close
chums, even if they were not before joining the
service.</p>

<p>"We've done it," breathed Hal, as he and
Noll straightened up and gazed about them.
"That takes the crimp out of a few veterans."</p>

<p>"Get a hike on, some of you men!" called
First Sergeant Gray briskly. Then he turned
to glare mildly at Hooper and Dowley, who were
finishing last.</p>

<p>Corporal Cotter, his own tent up with Corporal
Reynolds, turned to look down the company
street.</p>

<p>"Hooper, you and Dowley are going to hear
something," predicted the corporal dryly.</p>

<p>"That's done well enough," grumbled Dowley,
glancing at his tent.</p>

<p>Captain Cortland stood at the head of the company
street glancing down.</p>

<p>"One tent forward out of alignment," called
the company commander, then stepped down the
street. "Who are the men that occupy this
tent?" he demanded, halting.</p>

<p>"My tent, sir," mumbled Hooper.</p>

<p>"And mine, sir," added Dowley.</p>

<p>"Don't you men know how to erect a tent in
alignment with the street front?" inquired Captain
Cortland. "Take it down. Corporal Cotter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
stand by to see that these men set up their
tent in soldierly fashion."</p>

<p>"I told you you'd hear something," remarked
Cotter.</p>

<p>"Aw, what's the use of being so finicky about
a tent a quarter of an inch out of alignment?"
grumbled Hooper.</p>

<p>"The tent is more than that out of alignment,"
returned the corporal. "And there's every use
in the world in performing every duty in the
most soldierly fashion."</p>

<p>"Say," began Dowley argumentatively.</p>

<p>"Silence, and get on with your work," ordered
Corporal Cotter sharply. "Hooper,
you're close to thirty-five years old. Dowley,
you're around thirty. Yet those two kids, Overton
and Terry, are only eighteen, and they beat
you at every point in soldierliness."</p>

<p>"Soldiering is a kid's game," growled Dowley.</p>

<p>"The best men we get in the Army are those
we catch young," retorted Corporal Cotter.
"Stop! Tighten that cord a whole lot more."
"How does that suit you, Corp?" demanded
Dowley when, at last, the sulky bunkies had
again finished their task.</p>

<p>"Address me as Corporal, not Corp," returned
Cotter stiffly.</p>

<p>"Well, Corporal, how do you like the set of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
our tent now?" insisted Private Dowley.</p>

<p>"It looks better this time," assented the corporal.
"But, after this, you men, instead of
sneering at the kids of the company, will do well
to show yourselves as good men."</p>

<p>"We're always getting the kids rubbed into
us," growled Hooper.</p>

<p>"Because they're head and shoulders over you
both as soldiers," rejoined Corporal Cotter,
turning on his heel. "Even William Green is a
lot ahead of you as a soldier."</p>

<p>As Dowley turned to glance scowlingly up
the street he caught the glance of Captain Cortland,
glancing once more down the street.</p>

<p>"Your tent is in proper alignment this time,
men," nodded the company commander, and
went away.</p>

<p>Now the creaking of heavy wagons was heard
along the trail, accompanied by the loud voices
of the drivers. The expedition was accompanied
by six heavy wagons, each drawn by four mules.</p>

<p>"Water in the brook; wood two hundred
yards southeast!" shouted Lieutenant Prescott,
who had been sent scouting for these necessities.
On pitching camp the first task is always to
learn where wood and the best drinking water
can be found in the neighborhood. Often the
water close at hand is forbidden for cooking and
drinking purposes in favor of clear water at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
a distance.</p>

<p>Three of the approaching wagons continued
along the trail, while the other three turned in
at the side of the grove.</p>

<p>Corporal Reynolds and four men were detailed
to unload and put up the eight-by-ten
khaki-colored tent that was to be occupied by
the three company officers.</p>

<p>"I notice that the wide stripes don't care
about sleeping in pup-houses," grumbled
Hooper to his bunkie.</p>

<p>"Wide-stripe" is the nick-name sometimes
given an officer on account of the fact that the
side stripe down the trousers' leg of the blue
uniform is much broader than that worn by
the non-commissioned officer. Privates wear no
stripes on the trousers' leg, with the exception
of musicians, who wear two very narrow parallel
stripes.</p>

<p>Soon after the erection of the little village of
tents, the soldiers scattered, though they soon
returned with bundles of fire wood.</p>

<p>"You had better go and chase the stuff for
our fire, Bill," proposed Dowley.</p>

<p>"Chase it yourself," retorted Hooper.</p>

<p>"Not this trip," retorted Dowley. "It's up
to you this time."</p>

<p>Hooper swore that he wouldn't, but it ended
by his starting tardily after fagots. Dowley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
was already gaining the ascendancy over Private
Bill and making a half servant of him.</p>

<p>Presently some forty fires were blazing
brightly in an irregular line at a distance of
some yards from the line of dog-tents. American
soldiers were preparing their evening meal
in the field. The operation was an extremely
simple one. First, each soldier dropped a handful
of coffee beans into his agate drinking cup.
With the butt of the bayonet he crushed these
beans, the fineness depending upon his skill.
Then from the canteen each man poured water
enough nearly to fill the cup, which was then
set on the fire for boiling.</p>

<p>By the time that the coffee had boiled for a
few minutes each soldier returned his cup to
the ground beside him. A dash of cold water
from his canteen was sufficient to "settle" the
coffee.</p>

<p>Now, each man placed two or three strips of
bacon in his frying pan and laid it on the coals.
While these morsels were sizzling the soldier
turned his attention to sweetening his coffee.
Then, when the bacon was cooked to his satisfaction,
each man brought out his field hard
tack, munching alternately on biscuit and meat.</p>

<p>"Yesterday was Sunday, and we had raised
biscuits, roast beef and potatoes, with real
gravy," grunted Dowley. "If a stingy government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
would give us more wagons we could have
that every day."</p>

<p>"In war time," broke in Sergeant Hupner,
"you might feel lucky if you saw the Army
oven working once in a month. I've been there,
and I've had to live for weeks on bacon, hard
tack and coffee. Sometimes we didn't have the
coffee or the bacon, either."</p>

<p>"That's a dog's life," grumbled Dowley.</p>

<p>"No; it's a man's life, at need, but only a
man can stand it in the field," returned the
sergeant gravely.</p>

<p>After supper many of the men smoked, but
Hal and Noll, as they did not indulge in the weed,
strolled down toward the trail.</p>

<p>"Isn't this great?" breathed Hal Overton,
staring off over the distant mountain tops. "The
field duty, I mean."</p>

<p>"It's great, and I wouldn't have missed it
for anything," agreed Noll. "But it would
do no good to try to tell anything of the sort
to fellows like Hooper and Dowley."</p>

<p>"They're bad eggs," muttered Hal. "I wonder
how such men ever got past with their references
and managed to be accepted for the service."</p>

<p>"It is queer," nodded Noll. "But neither will
stay in the service beyond the first enlistment."</p>

<p>"Yet they conduct themselves just well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
enough to escape any real censure from the
company officers."</p>

<p>First Sergeant Gray was now moving through
the camp, notifying the men who were chosen
for guard duty that night. But neither Hal nor
Noll were warned for detail that night.</p>

<p>Not long after dark tattoo was sounded by
one of the buglers. Fifteen minutes later taps
sounded, and all but the guard turned in in
their dog-tents.</p>

<p>Each soldier is provided with a warm blanket
and a rubber poncho, which is a blanket with
a slit in the middle so that the head may be
thrust through and the poncho worn, at need,
as a rain coat. But to-night Noll Terry spread
his poncho on the ground, Hal laying his a-top.
Then both young soldiers lay down, drawing up
their combined stock of blankets over them, for
the early night had turned out chilly.</p>

<p>"Rest enough, now, for to-morrow's hike,"
mumbled Hal drowsily.</p>

<p>"Yes; unless we're turned out to meet a
night surprise," returned Noll dryly.</p>

<p>In another part of the camp Hooper and Dowley,
both warned for the guard, but not yet on
post, were whispering by themselves.</p>

<p>"To-morrow Kid Overton begins to get his,"
chuckled Hooper.</p>

<p>"Yes; he'll begin to see those corporal's
chevrons fading in the distance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"We ought to fix Terry with him."</p>

<p>"One at a time; that'll be surer," scowled
Private Dowley.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll slept the night through. Hal
dreamed he was chasing an elusive rascal, who
performed wretchedly on the cornet. As the
rascal fled he continued to play on the cornet.</p>

<p>Then young Private Overton opened his eyes.
The cornet player turned out to be the bugler,
who was blowing lustily, twice through, the first
call to reveille. Hal sprang up from his blankets.
After he had crawled out of the pup-house,
Noll joined him.</p>

<p>Wood and water were quickly brought. The
field breakfast was like the field supper of the
night before. Then the bugler got busy without
delay. The men fell in and roll-call was read.
Immediately Captain Cortland's crisp voice gave
the orders that opened up the ranks. An unexpected
inspection was on.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Hamilton stepped before the first
platoon, Lieutenant Prescott before the second.
Inspection of pieces was on.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll stood in the second platoon,
about half way down the line.</p>

<p>Noll held his piece at port arms as soon as
Lieutenant Prescott reached the man before him.
By the time that the young West Pointer halted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
before Noll, Hal, as the next man, threw his rifle
over to port arms.</p>

<p>The inspection of Noll's rifle proved satisfactory.
Then the lieutenant halted before Overton.</p>

<p>"Open your magazine," commanded Lieutenant
Prescott.</p>

<p>Hal obeyed.</p>

<p>"Draw your bolt."</p>

<p>Hal did so, after a hard tug, holding the bolt
in his hand.</p>

<p>"Let me look at that bolt," ordered Prescott,
gazing at the piece of steel mechanism in astonishment.
He took it from the young soldier's
hand and looked thunderstruck.</p>

<p>"Don't replace your bolt until ordered, Private
Overton. Fall out to the rear."</p>

<p>Overwhelmed with amazement, his face flushing
hotly with shame, Private Hal Overton gave
his officer the rifle salute, then obeyed.</p>

<p>Noll Terry's face went white with anxiety
over his bunkie's misfortune.</p>

<p>When inspection had been completed, Lieutenant
Prescott made his report to Captain
Cortland, who immediately followed his young
second lieutenant to where Hal stood.</p>

<p>"What's this, Overton?" asked the captain
coldly. "I thought you were one of our model
young soldiers. Why, your rifle-bolt must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
been in the fire. The end is out of shape, the
temper is drawn&mdash;and here are file-marks on
the bolt. It's unserviceable. I don't believe
you could fire the piece."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not, sir," Hal admitted.</p>

<p>"Load with a blank cartridge, my man, and
try to fire the piece."</p>

<p>Returning the bolt, Hal slipped in a blank.
But he could not drive the bolt home for firing.</p>

<p>"Ruined, my man," commented the captain
stiffly. "Overton, this piece has been in your
care. How did this happen?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>"Corporal Cotter!"</p>

<p>The corporal came over briskly.</p>

<p>"Corporal, Private Overton is in arrest until
released. You will march him as a prisoner at
the rear of the company and turn him over to
the guard at night."</p>

<p>Corporal Cotter again saluted. Then, as the
company officer and the young lieutenant started
away, Cotter stationed himself beside Overton.</p>

<p>"Put your bolt back in the piece as far as
it will go," ordered Cotter. "Tie it in place."</p>

<p>The men in ranks ahead had heard enough
to realize that Private Hal Overton was in disgrace,
and most of them were sorry.</p>

<p>Noll Terry was more than sorry.</p>

<small>SOLDIER HAL MARCHES AS A PRISONER</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE company broke ranks under orders to
strike camp at once.</p>

<p>Within six minutes the camp was
down. Every enlisted man had his blanket roll
made up and in place, and all his other equipment
on.</p>

<p>Corporal Cotter stood over Hal even while he
was making up his roll.</p>

<p>"How on earth did that thing happen?" murmured
Noll wretchedly.</p>

<p>"Silence; no talking with the prisoner," rebuked
Corporal Cotter crisply.</p>

<p>So Noll held his peace, though he was "boiling"
inside.</p>

<p>Again the company was assembled.</p>

<p>"Fours right, march! By file, march!"</p>

<p>B Company again struck the trail, heading
further up into the mountains, leaving the
wagons to follow presently. Though B Company
was now likely to be attacked at any time
in sham battle, by C Company, it had been
agreed that the respective wagon trains of the
companies were to be immune from capture on
this day.</p>

<p>"Overton, keep a distance of ten paces from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the rear man of the company, and march before
me," commanded Cotter. "Keep the step
carefully until the order for route step comes."</p>

<p>Never in his life had Hal Overton felt as
heart-sick as he did now.</p>

<p>Marching to the rear, a prisoner!</p>

<p>It was, in every sense, as bad as being in the
guard-house.</p>

<p>Up ahead in the line things were "doing,"
but to this Hal, in his new misery, was all but
blind.</p>

<p>Sergeant Hupner, with six men, had been sent
ahead as a "point" to discover any possible
enemy who might be lurking in the way of the
forward progress of B Company.</p>

<p>Scouts had been sent out on either flank. The
line moved slowly, as though fearing the presence
of an actual enemy. There were frequent
halts. At one time, while the line waited, Lieutenant
Prescott took a detachment of twelve men
to explore the country ahead. When he returned,
reporting no enemy developed, B Company
moved forward, though never without
point and flankers.</p>

<p>At noon B Company, still having stirred up
no enemy, halted for dinner.</p>

<p>Captain Cortland and his two young officers
got through their meal with soldierly despatch.
Then the company commander called to Sergeant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Gray, who reported, saluting.</p>

<p>"Sergeant, direct Corporal Cotter to bring
his prisoner here."</p>

<p>Seated on a small boulder, the captain eyed
young Overton keenly as the latter was brought
up.</p>

<p>"Private Overton," began Cortland, "have
you yet discovered, or really suspected, how
your rifle bolt came to be in such bad shape?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Hal, again saluting.</p>

<p>"At first glance it looked like a case of sheer
neglect on your part to care for your piece."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"But those file marks?"</p>

<p>"I can't explain them, sir."</p>

<p>"It is forbidden for any man to use a file on
the parts of his rifle, except by direct permission
from one of the company officers."</p>

<p>"I know it, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you had any such permission?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you a file?"</p>

<p>"Not a real one, sir. Only a manicure file."</p>

<p>"Let me see it."</p>

<p>Hal turned over the file, after finding it in
his haversack.</p>

<p>"Now, let me have the bolt from your rifle."</p>

<p>Captain Cortland tried the file lightly in some
of the nicks in the bolt. Then he passed file and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
bolt over to Lieutenant Hampton.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hampton, don't these nicks seem to fit
this file remarkably well?" queried the company
commander.</p>

<p>"They appear to&mdash;very well, sir," replied
Lieutenant Hampton, testing the file in the nicks.</p>

<p>"What do you say, Mr. Prescott?"</p>

<p>The young second lieutenant studied file and
bolt attentively.</p>

<p>"I am obliged to agree, Captain, with yourself
and Mr. Hampton."</p>

<p>"Private Overton, think again. Do you still
care to deny that you employed the file on the
bolt of your rifle?"</p>

<p>"I deny it, sir, with all the emphasis of which
I am capable," was Hal's earnest retort. His
face was flushed, his breath came quickly, but
he looked straight and honestly into his commander's
eyes. There was no cringing in his
attitude. His high color was to be attributed
only to the humiliation of the position in which
he found himself.</p>

<p>"And this bolt has been in the fire," continued
Captain Cortland. "Just such a fire, let us
say, as you build three times a day for the preparation
of your food. The temper of the end
of the bolt is ruined."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. May I speak, Captain?"</p>

<p>"Go on, Overton."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Captain Cortland, I am aware how badly
this looks for me. But I assure you, sir, on
my honor as a soldier, that I have no guilty or
other knowledge of how the bolt came to be in
this fearful condition. I am entirely innocent,
sir, of any act that could have put the bolt in
such condition."</p>

<p>"You are not guilty even of negligence, Overton?"</p>

<p>"Not of any intentional negligence, sir."</p>

<p>"Then, Overton, you must have some sort of
suspicion of how this thing happened."</p>

<p>"I have a suspicion, Captain, but it is not
founded on anything that is yet very tangible,
sir."</p>

<p>"You think it an enemy's work?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. None but an enemy could do such
a thing as this to a comrade's rifle."</p>

<p>"Granted, but who is the enemy?"</p>

<p>"May I be excused, sir, from answering?"
asked Private Overton very respectfully.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it is quite possible that, in naming
an enemy, I may do some honest soldier an injury."</p>

<p>"You need not answer, then, Overton. Wait
here."</p>

<p>Captain Cortland stepped down from the small
boulder on which he had been seated. At a sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
from him Lieutenant Hampton walked away
with the company commander. The two remained
for some moments in low conversation.</p>

<p>"Overton!" summoned Captain Cortland, returning.</p>

<p>Hal saluted.</p>

<p>"This affair looks badly for you, and I want
it to be a lesson to you hereafter. You have had
an excellent record, Overton, since you joined
the regiment. For this time I am going to take
your word that you are ignorant of how the accident
to your rifle bolt happened. So you are
now released from arrest, and will rejoin your
company. If you suspect that any comrade is
guilty of this outrage on your bolt, I recommend
that you keep your eyes open for any
further attempts against your record. Corporal
Cotter, you will not repeat what has been said
here. Overton, you are released from arrest.
Corporal, report yourself to the first sergeant
as being on regular duty again."</p>

<p>Corporal and private sainted, then turned back
to the company.</p>

<p>"You got off easily," murmured Noll, when
his bunkie, with face white and eyes flashing,
joined him.</p>

<p>"That's because Captain Cortland decided to
take my word for my innocence in the matter,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Hal replied cautiously.</p>

<p>"Now, see here, old fellow, you've got to be
up and doing," urged Noll earnestly in a whisper.</p>

<p>"What can I do, now?" Hal asked.</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes peeled. You can find out,
by and by, who was responsible for that low
trick. Hal, you'll have to make vengeance your
watchword."</p>

<p>"Revenge is sweet," mimicked Hal dryly.</p>

<p>"It surely is&mdash;sometimes."</p>

<p>"But sweet things make one sick at his stomach,"
Hal uttered dryly.</p>

<p>"Well, if you're going to stand for having
a job like that put over on you," uttered Noll
disgustedly, "I'm not! The fellow who did that
trick to you isn't fit to be in the service, and
I'm going to get him out of it, whether you help
or not."</p>

<p>Separated from the young soldiers by only
a thin ledge of rock, eavesdropping Hooper and
Dowley heard, and gazed keenly at each other.</p>

<p>"We've got to frame things up for young
Terry, too, then!" whispered Bill Hooper, as
the sulky pair stole away.</p>

<small>THE JOKING SCOUT</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap2">"</span>C</span>AN you see the enemy, Overton?"</p>

<p>"I can't see a thing, Corporal."</p>

<p>"Move forward cautiously. Don't
make a sound. If you do you'll betray our position."</p>

<p>"How far shall I go, Corporal?"</p>

<p>"Move ahead until you run into signs of the
enemy. Above all, bear in mind that you mustn't
betray our presence to the enemy."</p>

<p>Private Hal Overton gripped his rifle tightly
in the darkness as he all but wriggled forward
over the ground.</p>

<p>It was all very real business to the soldiers engaged
in this mimic warfare. If nothing more
serious happened, any big mistake on the part
of a soldier in this sham warfare would bring
upon him the displeasure of his officers.</p>

<p>Late that same afternoon B Company had
been attacked by lurking C Company. Some
very clever man&oelig;uvring of the men under cover
bad been done, and a good deal of blank ammunition
had been fired. True, there had been
no real casualties, but, under the rules of the
game, B Company had made such a spirited and
excellent defense that C Company had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
driven further back.</p>

<p>Now the position of C Company was unknown,
but the "enemy" was believed to be lurking in
the vicinity, bent upon a night surprise.</p>

<p>Two thirds of B Company slept back in the
camp of pup-houses. The other third, under
command of Lieutenant Prescott, was divided
up among sentries, outposts and scouts.</p>

<p>To Corporal Cotter had been entrusted the
problem of taking a scouting party consisting
of three privates and trying to locate either the
enemy's outpost or the main body.</p>

<p>Just a moment before Hal's orders to prowl
forward a sound had been heard, evidently about
four hundred yards ahead.</p>

<p>So now Hal stole forward, moving as softly
as any cat could have done, this despite the fact
that his advance must be over jagged rocks here
and there.</p>

<p>The ground was ideal for ambush fighting.</p>

<p>Hal now had a new rifle, that had been issued
to him when the wagons of B Company came
up late that night. The damaged piece was now
in the wagon, and Hal bore a rifle on whose
efficient action he could depend.</p>

<p>"It's almost a mockery to have a gun, though,
just now," Hal smiled grimly as he lifted the
piece over a ledge of rock and followed.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't I get a clever roasting from Captain
Cortland if I dared to fire it while scouting."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Private Overton came to an open space
where he could walk more easily. He did not
hasten, however, for there was no telling when,
in the darkness, he might step on a stone and
send it rolling, with a resulting racket that would
warn the enemy, if any of them were within
hearing.</p>

<p>Every step had to be taken as though the
troops were in the midst of life and death war.
The rules of the game were strict, and any bit
of bad judgment was likely to count against
the score of the company to which the man belonged.</p>

<p>Every now and then the sham young scout
halted, peering backward, for it was going to
be of prime importance to him to know how to
get back when his scouting trip was done.</p>

<p>"Halt! Who's there?"</p>

<p>Overton did halt, flattening himself down
against the rock.</p>

<p>The hail, though softly spoken, had been unmistakable.</p>

<p>"Halt! Who's there?"</p>

<p>"You'll have to come here and find out,"
thought Overton.</p>

<p>Then, as silence followed, Hal, holding his
very breath, crawled some ten yards to the left.
Again he halted, but this time there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
faintly spoken challenge.</p>

<p>"I think I know where that fellow is," mused
Hal. "Is he a lone sentry, or part of an outpost?"</p>

<p>It required fifteen minutes now of the most
cautious procedure, but Private Overton at last
found himself hugging the ground at a point
from which he could just barely discern the
dimly defined figure of an alert sentry against
the skyline.</p>

<p>"I've got him between our camp and myself
now," thought Hal swiftly. "Now I've got to
be doubly careful. I don't care to have B Company
laughing at me because I got captured
while on scouting duty. But I'll settle the question
of whether that sentry is alone, or part of
an outpost."</p>

<p>Three minutes later, after some most careful
man&oelig;uvring, Overton had solved the question.
His grinning face was turned toward a corporal
and two men who lay rolled in their blankets
some ten yards behind the sentry.</p>

<p>"It's an outpost, all right," grinned Hal.
"Whee! How I would like to bag the outpost
and take them in as prisoners."</p>

<p>But that was out of the question&mdash;not to be
thought of.</p>

<p>Private Hal Overton found himself seized by
a spirit of mischief. It was the same type of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
impulse which, carried to the point of reckless
daring in real warfare, leads men on to swift
promotion.</p>

<p>Almost before he realized what he was doing
Hal had hidden his own rifle and was crawling
stealthily toward the sleeping men.</p>

<p>Beside the corporal lay his rifle. Barely
breathing, his body flattened against the ground.
Hal crept closer and closer, then stealthily withdrew
the rifle.</p>

<p>A moment or two later Hal had the captured
rifle lying on the ground beside his own.</p>

<p>"That's a real find to take back to camp,"
laughed Hal silently.</p>

<p>He was about to make off with the captured
piece when a new impulse seized him.</p>

<p>"Why not go back after more loot?" he asked
himself, grinning. "Jupiter, I'll do it!"</p>

<p>Every such move as this was fraught with
added danger. But Hal moved on his stomach,
taking plenty of time, always with his watchful
eyes on the dim figure of the sentry a few yards
away. That soldier, however, appeared to be
peering mostly in the direction where he believed
the camp of B Company to lie.</p>

<p>After a short time Hal, back in safety again,
gloated over the sight of three rifles beside his
own.</p>

<p>"I'll be a hog, if I don't look out!" chuckled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the young scout of sham warfare.</p>

<p>Yet, though this was no life and death fighting,
Private Overton had nevertheless a good
deal at stake. It would result in his being set
down as a rather stupid soldier should he be
captured by the enemy's outpost while on scouting
duty.</p>

<p>"I can't help it. I've got to have one more
try, anyway," decided the mischievous soldier
boy.</p>

<p>So back he crept. An instant later he tried
to make himself flatter against the earth than
he had been able yet to do.</p>

<p>For that sentry had now turned and was
looking in his direction.</p>

<p>"I commit myself to the darkness," gasped
Private Overton inwardly.</p>

<p>For, if his presence were detected, the sentry,
with one call, could bring the other three sleeping
men to their feet. Against such odds
Hal would have but scant chance of getting
away.</p>

<p>"And I'll have to leave my rifle behind if
I duck from here," thought Hal, beginning to
regret his rashness.</p>

<p>It was one thing to capture the rifles of the
outpost; it was quite another thing to leave his
own gun behind in their hands.</p>

<p>After a few moments of agony the dimly seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
sentry again turned his face in another direction.</p>

<p>"Now that I've started this trick, I'll put it
through or die," thought the soldier boy, setting
his teeth.</p>

<p>Again he crouched close to the corporal and
the two other sleepers. This time there appeared
to be no loot loose save a pair of canteens
that lay upon the ground. Private Hal Overton
made sure of these articles, then, as he lay
there, took a last sweeping look.</p>

<p>The shoes of Corporal Raynes, of C Company,
protruded under the foot of his blanket.</p>

<p>"I guess it would be too risky a stunt to try
to unlace the corporal's shoes and carry 'em
away," quivered mischievous Hal, eyeing the
footgear longingly.</p>

<p>Then, as he gazed, it struck the soldier boy
that there was something odd about the position
of the corporal's shoes with regard to the line
of Raynes body.</p>

<p>"I wonder if&mdash;&mdash;" cogitated Private Overton,
edging himself forward.</p>

<p>Hal made a cautious try.</p>

<p>His last guess proved to be correct. Corporal
Raynes had taken off his shoes to ease his aching
feet, and had tucked them in at the bottom
of his blanket.</p>

<p>"It's a shabby trick to play on a good
fellow," grinned the soldier boy, "but this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
war."</p>

<p>For the last time Hal crept back. Now an
even greater task confronted him, and that was
how to get away with all the outpost loot he
had captured.</p>

<p>By making three stealthy trips, Private Overton
at last succeeded in getting all the loot in
safety to a point more than one hundred yards
from the outpost.</p>

<p>"Now, it's time to drop nonsense for real
business," decided the young scout.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he had located the main
camp, and that without falling into the hands of
either of the two C Company sentries whom he
was compelled to pass in the black night.</p>

<p>Then back to the hidden loot the young soldier
returned.</p>

<p>"Whew, but that's going to be a pack!" muttered
Hal, gazing at it almost ruefully. "However,
I've got to take it. I won't leave a blessed
thing behind."</p>

<p>The canteens Overton threw over his shoulders,
so that he had one on each side, in addition
to his own, which hung at his left hip.
The corporal's shoes he tied to his belt. It was
the bunching of the four service rifles, with their
weight of more than forty pounds, that gave
him his real trouble. But at last he had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
four pieces lashed together and started.</p>

<p>"I've yet got to look out that I don't run into
any scouts of the enemy," thought the soldier
boy half ruefully. "Whew, what a break it
would be to be picked up with all this loot!"</p>

<p>It was a welcome sound indeed when, at last,
the young scout heard, near the spot where he
had left his own party, the almost whispered
challenge:</p>

<p>"Halt! Who's there?"</p>

<p>"Friend," responded Hal Overton in a tone
no louder.</p>

<p>"Halt where you are, friend, until a sentry
advances to recognize you," returned cautious
Corporal Cotter.</p>

<p>It was the corporal himself who came forward.</p>

<p>"Great Scott, Overton, what have you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's loot," returned Hal proudly.</p>

<p>"Where on earth did you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From the enemy's outpost. And I located
the camp, too. I could guide you right to either
outpost or main camp. Will you take these
guns, Corporal? My back feels broken."</p>

<p>"I should think it might," was Cotter's grinning
response, as he reached out and took the
lashed rifles. "Great Scott! What won't the
lieutenant and Captain Cortland say!"</p>

<p>Just as they stepped softly back, Private Noll
Terry challenged someone approaching softly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
from the rear.</p>

<p>"Halt! Who's there?"</p>

<p>"Officer of the day," returned Lieutenant
Prescott's low voice.</p>

<p>"Advance, officer of the day, to be recognized."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott advanced into the group.</p>

<p>"Do you see all this stuff, Lieutenant?" asked
Corporal Cotter, calling attention to Hal's loot
as it lay on the ground. "Overton went forward
as a scout, and located one of the enemy's
outposts, also the main camp. And he brought
back these souvenirs of the outpost."</p>

<p>"To whom do the shoes belong?" questioned
Lieutenant Prescott after looking at the stuff.</p>

<p>"To Corporal Raynes, sir, in command of
the outpost," returned the soldier boy, with a
grin.</p>

<p>"How did you get hold of all this stuff, Overton?"</p>

<p>Hal told his story briefly.</p>

<p>"Great Scott! Bombshells and grenades,
what a roaring joke on the enemy! Overton,
you're a man worth having in B Company.
Dark as the night is, your exploit would reflect
credit on a trained Indian scout. Overton, I'm
going to take you back to camp with me. I'll
wake Captain Cortland to hear your report as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
to the enemy's position. And the captain will
surely want to see this loot of the outpost and
to hear your tale of how you got it. Here, let
me have a couple of those rifles to carry for
you."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott led the way hack to B
Company's camp. And he shook with laughter
all the way.</p>

<small>THE CORPORAL WITH THE SHEEPISH GRIN</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>APTAIN Cortland heard the young
scout's report without losing his gravity,
though he decided against trying a night
attack on the enemy beyond.</p>

<p>"Overton," he commented, "if you can do
things like to-night's work very often there will
be no doubt whatever that you have in you the
making of a real genius for scouting. I commend
you most heartily for this work."</p>

<p>It was only when he went back to his tent to
lie down that Captain Cortland gave way to
silent laughter.</p>

<p>At daybreak the camp was astir. The men
who had been on guard duty and scouting
through the night came in, somewhat heavy-eyed,
after a relief had been marched out to
take their places.</p>

<p>These returned soldiers, as soon as they had
breakfasted, threw themselves on the ground,
under such shade as they could find, and took
an hour of solid sleep.</p>

<p>"The wagon train is approaching, sir," reported
Sergeant Gray.</p>

<p>"Then pass the order for the men to report
at the train and draw rations to last until to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
night," directed Captain Cortland.
"After to-morrow night the two companies will
be together again for the balance of the field
work."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott was acting as commissary
officer for B Company, and he went immediately
to the trail. Captain Cortland, stepping into his
tent, buckled on his sword and then sauntered
down to the wagon train to see that all went
smoothly.</p>

<p>As he reached the spot where the soldiers of
B Company were drawing their rations, Captain
Cortland caught sight of a corporal perched on
the seat beside the driver of one of the wagons.</p>

<p>"You here, Corporal Haynes?" demanded
Captain Cortland, striving hard to preserve his
official gravity.</p>

<p>Grinning sheepishly, Corporal Haynes&mdash;in
his stocking feet&mdash;sprang down into the trail
and saluted.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he admitted.</p>

<p>"Ill?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Were you captured, then?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," answered Haynes, the sheepish
look in his face increasing. "But I'm a non-combatant,
sir; ruled out of the man&oelig;uvres and
ordered to stay with the wagon train, sir."</p>

<p>"How did that happen?" inquired the captain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
though he was able to make a very good
guess.</p>

<p>"While I was on outpost during the night, sir,
my shoes were taken from me. I suspect, sir,
that one of your scouts got 'em."</p>

<p>"But we have quartermaster's supplies along.
Why didn't you draw a new pair of shoes this
morning?"</p>

<p>"No shoes of my size, sir, in the supplies,"
reported Raynes, once more saluting. "So Captain
Freeman told me that I certainly couldn't
fight in my stocking feet. Therefore, sir, he ordered
me to join the wagon train and respect
all the obligations of a non-combatant."</p>

<p>"Too bad, too bad, Corporal, for you are a
valuable man," went on Captain Cortland.</p>

<p>"I don't feel like one this morning, sir, after
having my shoes taken," grinned the C Company
corporal in embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Well, since you've been ordered among the
non-combatants," continued Cortland, after
turning slightly and espying the grinning face
of Private Hal Overton, "I think the scout who
captured your shoes may as well return them.
But hold on. I see two other men of your company
on the wagons."</p>

<p>Again Corporal Raynes grinned sheepishly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir! they had their rifles taken, and
so are no longer combatants in a military sense.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
My rifle is missing also, sir."</p>

<p>"My, my, my!" murmured Captain Cortland
in a tone of mock commiseration. "Then the
scout who plundered you all may as well return
all the property. But of course, Corporal, you
and the two other men will continue to be
non-combatants as long as the sham fighting
lasts."</p>

<p>"Those are Captain Freeman's orders, sir."</p>

<p>Again Captain Cortland turned toward Hal
Overton, nodding a signal. Hal stepped away
briskly, but came back bearing the pair of shoes,
the rifles and the canteens.</p>

<p>"Private Overton is the scout who entered
your lines alone and brought about the discomfiture
of C Company," Captain Cortland announced,
smilingly.</p>

<p>The captain walked away while Corporal
Raynes, sitting on the ground, drew on his shoes
and laced them, while a lot of B Company's men
stood about and grinned over his discomfiture.</p>

<p>"Corporal, you're sure good sleepers over in
C Company," laughed Private Hyman. "You
fellows want to look out that, some night, you
don't get taken in by a lot of amateur hunters
from New York."</p>

<p>"Great guns, what's going to happen to the
regular Army, when it's getting so that a whole
company of infantry can't guard its own property?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
another B Company man wanted to
know.</p>

<p>Corporal Raynes and his two comrades had
to stand a lot of good-natured joshing from the
crowding men of B Company.</p>

<p>When he stood up, Raynes turned to Hal
Overton.</p>

<p>"Rookie," he growled, "you want to look out
hard in the future. I'll pay you back for this
in kind. Just remember, kid, that Corporal
Raynes wasn't born yesterday!"</p>

<p>Hal laughed good-humoredly. He didn't
know, at that moment, that not many hours
would pass ere Corporal Raynes would find his
opportunity.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes after the wagon train had
pulled out, B Company started cautiously
through the country ahead. It was B Company's
task to advance through a supposedly
hostile country; C Company's part in the under-taking
was either to annihilate B, or to capture
the company.</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock that morning ere B and C
came in touch. The point and scouting squad
ran into one platoon of C.</p>

<p>"Deploy your men and take cover," ordered
Lieutenant Prescott, who was in charge of the
advance. "Each corporal regulate the firing
of his squad. Jam the fire in hard whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
you are sure you locate the enemy."</p>

<p>Bang! Bang! Bang! As fast as the squads
reached their places on the line, each man some
nine feet from his nearest fellows, the firing of
blank ammunition ripped out fast and hard.
There was all the excitement of actual warfare,
except that no soldier was actually hit.</p>

<p>B Company's men would have been driven
back had not Lieutenant Hampton swiftly arrived
on the scene with the entire first platoon
of B Company.</p>

<p>"We'll advance by rushes, Mr. Prescott," announced
Lieutenant Hampton as soon as he
reached the younger officer, who saluted.</p>

<p>Prescott hastened, crouching low, down along
the left wing of the little command.</p>

<p>Presently Hampton's voice rose, even over
the firing as it ran low, and called:</p>

<p>"Rise! Charge!"</p>

<p>Uttering their battle yell, the little force of
infantry rushed forward in its thin line, while
the hidden men of C Company poured in a heavy
fire.</p>

<p>"Halt! Lie down!" shouted Lieutenant
Hampton. "Ready, load, aim!"</p>

<p>There came a brief pause, followed by the
order:</p>

<p>"Fire!"</p>

<p>A single volley crashed out, with such unanimity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
that it sounded as though one big piece had
been fired.</p>

<p>"Ready! Open magazines! Load magazines!
At will, commence firing!"</p>

<p>Fifteen rounds had been fired ere the bugler
sounded furiously the order:</p>

<p>"Cease firing!"</p>

<p>The rush of feet sounded behind. Lieutenant
Prescott rushed to the rear, but soon waved his
sword reassuringly. It was the balance of B
Company advancing on the run.</p>

<p>Captain Cortland now took command in person.
He ordered another rush forward toward
C Company's position.</p>

<p>Three volleys were fired after the rush. The
fire was not answered. A cautious advance developed
the fact that the force of C Company
men had retired, nor could the line of their flight
be discovered. B Company halted for a few
moments, that the men might clean their sooty
rifle chambers.</p>

<p>"We didn't really see the enemy," Hal remarked,
as he worked his cleaning rod and a
bit of waste through his gun barrel.</p>

<p>"In warfare nowadays you rarely do see the
enemy," remarked Sergeant Hupner. "Attacking
an enemy's position, nowadays, is a good
deal like taking a gun and going into a dark room
where some one is shooting at you. You can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
see the other fellow, but you have a mighty uncomfortable
notion that he sees you and is shooting
straight at you."</p>

<p>"Pleasant, when the game is real war,"
laughed Noll.</p>

<p>"Deadly, of course," commented Hupner.</p>

<p>Once again, late in the afternoon, C Company
endeavored to ambush B Company. Captain
Cortland's point and flankers, however, developed
the enemy's position by drawing their
fire. B Company, after a brisk fight of twenty
minutes' duration, drove C Company back and
continued to advance.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that no one had been really
killed or wounded, most of the soldiers, who
were serving their first enlistment, now found
the game a wholly exciting one. When B Company
halted, after the second engagement, the
men fell into an eager discussion of the late
engagement, the sergeants and other older men
adding many comments out of their experiences
in actual fighting.</p>

<p>"It leaves only real war to be desired," declared
Hal, his cheeks glowing and his eyes snapping.</p>

<p>"Huh! If this was real war there'd be a lot
of kids of the talky kind ducking to get away,"
growled Private Dowley as he slouched by.</p>

<p>"It isn't the kid soldiers who do the deserting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
in war time," returned Sergeant Hupner quietly.
"It's usually some of the older men, who have
such a grouch with life that one wouldn't think
they'd care about living much longer."</p>

<p>Dowley scowled, muttering something, but he
did not venture to dispute with a man of Hupner's
military experience.</p>

<p>"I guess that ought to hold Dowley for five
minutes," laughed Noll.</p>

<p>"That fellow gives me a sense of fatigue,"
remarked Sergeant Hupner placidly. "He
might turn out to be a good soldier under stress,
but all I've got to say is that I wouldn't want
to have to defend a position with only a squad
or two of men of his type. I wonder how the
recruiting officer ever came to let him into the
service?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he got in under somebody else's
name on a stolen set of references," laughed
Hal.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Hupner, I want two of your men
to send back with a message," announced Captain
Cortland, stepping up.</p>

<p>"Overton and Terry are in good condition,
sir," reported Hupner, rising and saluting as
soon as he saw his commander.</p>

<p>"Very good; come with me, Overton and
Terry."</p>

<p>Captain Cortland led the two young soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
down the trail, drawing a local map from one
of his pockets and spreading it on a flat table
of rock.</p>

<p>"Study this map carefully, men, for I want
you to be sure of the road you're to take. You
will have to go back about four miles&mdash;two of it
off this trail. You'll find a little telegraph station
there. I want you to deliver, for transmission,
this message to Colonel North, at Fort
Clowdry."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Hal answered. "Shall we wait
for the answer?"</p>

<p>"No; the answer will not be due until to-morrow.
As soon as you have turned over your
message, retrace your way to this point. B
Company will have gone ahead. But a little
way above here the trail broadens, and you'll
find a house now and then. You can inquire for
news of which way we've gone. You'll have to
find us as best you can. And Overton!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Remember that these are sham man&oelig;uvres,
and that C Company stands for the enemy."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Either or both of you might be captured
by a detachment from C Company."</p>

<p>"We'll do our level best to prevent that, sir,"
Hal promised, and Noll nodded with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Even worse than your own capture would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
be the capture of this message," Captain Cortland
added impressively. "This message, in
effect, is my attempt to communicate with my
base of supplies, represented by Fort Clowdry.
If you fail to put the message through, and C
Company captures it, then Captain Freeman
and his men have scored heavily against us."</p>

<p>"Is it proper for me to ask, sir, whether Captain
Freeman knows that you are trying to send
this message?"</p>

<p>"Captain Freeman does not know, to a certainty,
but he may suspect, and he may have
men out to catch you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. C Company's men won't
get us if there's any way to prevent it."</p>

<p>"Join the company as soon as you can locate
us, men. Firing may guide you, but, in that
case, you'll have to avoid joining the wrong
company."</p>

<p>Both young soldiers once more saluted. Then,
with the message securely tucked in Hal's haversack,
the bunkies started down the trail. They
had not gone many yards ere they heard the
orders for Cortland's company to fall in for
the advance.</p>

<p>A mile of the distance Hal and Noll had covered
when they encountered the slow-moving
wagon train.</p>

<p>"Hello, rookies!" called Corporal Raynes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
banteringly. "Where are you headed."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's surely a fine day, Corporal,"
nodded Hal, as the two bunkies hurried on.</p>

<p>"That Overton kid is the one I must get hunk
with before many days are over," grunted
Raynes. "I must make him look as cheap with
his company commander as he's made me look
with mine."</p>

<p>When the wagon train had gone about two
miles and a half further up the trail Corporal
Raynes shook with his own chuckles.</p>

<p>He had run across his chance, and was shrewd
enough to recognize it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>RAYNES FINDS A PATRIOTIC ALLY</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE trail was broader here.</p>

<p>Some thirty feet from the rough road
an old-time log cabin, well preserved,
stood in a little grove of trees.</p>

<p>Before the door, on a backless chair, sat an
old man, roughly clad in buckskin, who was dividing
his time between talking to a dog and
cleaning the old rifle that lay across his knees.</p>

<p>As the horses had had a hard pull, the wagon
boss ordered a halt on this level stretch of trail.</p>

<p>Corporal Raynes, his head buzzing with half
a dozen plans, leaped down from the wagon in
his restored shoes. He sauntered slowly over
to this old-time hunter.</p>

<p>"'Day, Pop," he greeted the old man.</p>

<p>"'Day," grunted the other. "You're a soger,
I reckon?"</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Raynes, seating himself on
the ground and producing his pipe. "Uniform
gives me away, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Some," returned the old hunter. "There's
been a thunderin' lot of ye around to-day. I've
heard a heap of firing twicet to-day."</p>

<p>Corporal Raynes nodded.</p>

<p>"Wa'n't shooting up nothing real, was ye?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
inquired the old man.</p>

<p>"No, Pop; what we call man&oelig;uvres," Baynes
explained.</p>

<p>"Jest plain, tom-fool, sham fighting, eh?"</p>

<p>"That's it," nodded the corporal. "But it
isn't so tom-fool, after all. It teaches soldiers
a lot about the real man&oelig;uvres of war."</p>

<p>"Huh! I wonder ef it teaches ary mother's
son of ye any better how to fight the Japs when
your time comes?"</p>

<p>"You think we're going to fight the Japs
some day, do you?" inquired Baynes, finishing
the filling of his pipe.</p>

<p>"Think?" retorted the old man testily. "I
don't have to think. Some day we've got to
depend on you sogers to drive them pesky brown
critters back into the Pacific Ocean, or the Japs
will own the whole coast and clean up here to
the Rockies."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to like the Japs, Pop?" observed
Corporal Baynes, puffing at his pipe.</p>

<p>"Like 'em? The same way I do pizen, rattlers
and grizzlies!" exclaimed the old man with unlooked-for
passion.</p>

<p>Corporal Baynes jumped inwardly with glee.
In a flash the whole of his plan came to him.</p>

<p>"Have you seen any soldiers go by on this
trail, Pop?" asked Baynes.</p>

<p>"Some," nodded the old man. "'Bout an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
hour ago nigh onter a hundred of 'em went by.
'Bout twenty minutes ergo 'nuther hundred
or so came along and tramped up that way.
They didn't stop, so I didn't ask any questions."</p>

<p>"If you had," prodded Corporal Baynes,
"you would have learned something. The first
company was C Company, and they represent
American soldiers."</p>

<p>"Well, that's what they are&mdash;American
sogers. Why shouldn't they stand for it?"</p>

<p>"But you see, the second company that went
by here&mdash;B Company&mdash;they stand for Japs. In
the game of man&oelig;uvres that the officers are playing
the second company, B, are supposed to be
a force of Japanese troops that are chasing the
American troops through the Rockies."</p>

<p>"What do they wanter play that for?" demanded
the old hunter, his eyes blazing wrathfully.
"Why don't yer fool officers play that
it's American sogers chasing Japs back to where
they belong?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, the Americans may yet win
out, before the game is played through," Baynes
offered consolingly. "It all depends on which
company is man&oelig;uvred better by its officers.
I belong to C Company, by the way; the American
forces, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon I like ye better for that," <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
nodded the old man.</p>

<p>"Pop, I wonder if you'd be willing to help the
American company beat the Japanese company
and bag it, whole hog?" proposed Raynes
cleverly.</p>

<p>"Would I?" demanded the old man eagerly.
"But, sho! What could I do, d'ye reckon?"</p>

<p>"Now, Pop, I reckon a couple of hours from
now, or maybe three, there'll be two young
soldiers come up along this way. You'll know
'em when you see 'em."</p>

<p>Raynes dropped into a description of Hal and
Noll, while the old man listened attentively.</p>

<p>"Now, they'll probably ask you, Pop, which
way the second company went. That's B Company,
the Japs, you know. If they don't ask
you outright, then you must fix it for 'em to ask
you."</p>

<p>"I'll manage it," nodded the old hunter, a
look of craft coming into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Now, don't let the make-believe Jap soldiers
know that their company kept on up this trail.
Tell 'em anything you like that'll send then
off the trail&mdash;over to that hill, say," continued
Corporal Raynes, pointing to a rocky peak distant
about three miles. "Send 'em hiking
straight over there. Then they won't get
through with their news in time, and the American
company will have a fair chance to bag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the Jap company, whole hog. D'you see?"</p>

<p>"Don't I, though?" demanded the old-time
hunter.</p>

<p>"Think you can work it, Pop?"</p>

<p>"Young man," demanded the hunter, "d'ye
reckon I look like anybody's fool?"</p>

<p>"You sure don't," nodded Raynes. "And
here's something to pay you for your trouble."</p>

<p>The scheming corporal tried to slip a two-dollar
bill into the other's hand, but the latter
drew away from it.</p>

<p>"Take it," urged Raynes. "It's government
money."</p>

<p>"Young man, I'm an American, and I don't
have to be paid to stand by my own country!
I'll do all ye say, and more, ef I git a chance,
jest to see the American company wallop the
make-believe Jap company."</p>

<p>"You'll do us a huge service if you don't fall
down on the job, Pop. Why, the news will travel
all the way to Japan, and the Japs will gnash
their teeth over it."</p>

<p>"I'll put the trick through fur ye, young
man&mdash;even if I have to use bear traps to ketch
the two young soger boys ye told me about,"
promised the aged hunter earnestly.</p>

<p>"Say, Corporal, cut your tether, if you're
going to ride with us," called the wagon boss.</p>

<p>"I'm coming," announced Corporal Raynes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
rising. "Don't forget, Pop," he whispered back
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Ye kin trust me, young man!"</p>

<p>By the time he was out of sight of the cabin,
around a turn of the road, the chuckles inside
of Corporal Raynes got so close to the surface
that they surged over.</p>

<p>"What's the smile, Corporal?" demanded the
wagon boss.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm pretty near choking over one of the
lying yarns that old fellow told me about how
he bagged twelve grizzlies single handed one
day," lied the corporal.</p>

<p>"He must be a talented old liar," nodded the
wagon boss.</p>

<p>"He is," agreed Corporal Raynes. "I never
could understand, either, why anyone would take
the trouble to lie unless he was paid for it."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hal and Noll, all unsuspicious of trouble of
any other kind than that against which Captain
Cortland had warned them, kept on cautiously
along the trail, then branched off at the road
shown them on the map. Two miles further on
they reached a village, with its two hotels for
health-seekers, cottages and other buildings.</p>

<p>Even in this basin in the mountains the Western
Union Company had penetrated. The two
young military messengers found the telegraph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
office, turned over their message and then were
ready to return.</p>

<p>"But, war or no war," declared Noll bluntly,
"I'm not going to start back until I've crossed
the street and had an ice cream soda."</p>

<p>"We'll have two," laughed Hal boyishly,
"and then make up for lost time on the trail."</p>

<p>Unmindful of the curious glances cast at two
soldiers in full field equipment, Hal and Noll
enjoyed their treat to the utmost. Then they
started back, traveling fast.</p>

<p>Nor did they run into any lurking detachments
from C Company. Their "hike," as a
fast march is termed, was uneventful until they
reached the old hunter's cabin.</p>

<p>"Pop" was awaiting their coming, and a keen
look flashed into his old eyes when he saw them
and recognized them from Raynes's description.</p>

<p>"Sogers, hey?" he demanded, going sociably
down to the road.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," nodded Hal respectfully as he
paused.</p>

<p>"Seen a lot of 'em go by to-day," continued
the hunter.</p>

<p>"Then you're the man we want to see, sir,"
went on Private Overton. "Did two companies
go by this way?"</p>

<p>"Yes, soger boy. They was 'bout three-quarters
of an hour apart. And I reckon ye belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
to the second one. Let me describe yer captain."</p>

<p>The old hunter gave a clear description of the
personal appearance of B Company's commander.
There is little that escapes a hunter's
eyes or recollection.</p>

<p>"Yes," broke in Hal eagerly. "That was our
commander, Captain Cortland."</p>

<p>"I wanted to be dead sure," resumed the old
hunter artfully, "for yer captain left a message
for ye, and he wanted me to be particular
that no other sogers got it."</p>

<p>"Naturally," assented Hal unsuspiciously.</p>

<p>"Jest above here," continued the hunter,
"yer captain turned his men to the left and went
off over the rocks, kinder careful like, as though
he didn't want any other sogers to see where
his men was going."</p>

<p>"Yes; of course," agreed Hal. "That's part
of field man&oelig;uvres."</p>

<p>"The word yer captain left with me, soger
boy, was that he was going to camp his men&mdash;hidden,
of course, ye understand&mdash;on that peak
yonder to-night. That's where he said ye two
soger boys was to join yer company. Reckon
ye kin travel over that-a-way? There ain't no
trail to that peak, ye understand?"</p>

</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>"Of course we can, sir," Hal answered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>respectfully. "If the rest of the company can go
to that peak we can follow our comrades there."</p>

<p>"Then I've delivered my message from yer
captain," finished the old hunter with a satisfied
air.</p>

<p>"And thank you very much," acknowledged
Hal. Both he and Noll saluted the venerable old
man of former times.</p>

<p>"Nice spoken soger lads, them," muttered
"Pop," as he watched the bunkies step off the
trail and start to cross the rocky wastes to the
distant peak. "If they wa'n't make-believe Japs
in this tom-fool sham fight I'd feel ashamed of
myself. But I reckon a little extry hardship will
do 'em good, anyway."</p>

<p>"Say," muttered Noll, halting, when they had
gone something more than a mile of the rough
way, "I don't want to criticize my commanding
officer, but I wish he had chosen a camping spot
that was easier to reach."</p>

<p>"It's a dandy good place up on that peak,
anyway," laughed Hal, whose feet were beginning
to feel decidedly sore. "C Company's men
wouldn't enjoy hiking over this rough ground
in the dark to make a night attack."</p>

<p>They covered another mile.</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to think that old fellow gave
us a false scent," grumbled Noll. "I don't believe
Captain Cortland would be heartless
enough to march heavily laden soldiers over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
ground like this."</p>

<p>"Why, the old man back at the cabin was
the soul of courtesy, and he described Captain
Cortland to a dot," returned Hal.</p>

<p>Dusk was coming on by the time the bunkies
had covered the rest of the distance, and had
reached the ledges near the top of the lonely
peak.</p>

<p>"Now, where's B Company?" demanded Noll
almost savagely.</p>

<p>"Come along this way," proposed Overton.
"We'll explore."</p>

<p>Through the gloaming the sore-footed soldier
boys plodded on until Noll suddenly halted, gripping
Hal stoutly.</p>

<p>Right in front of them, ambling their way,
came a huge furry something. It wasn't a grizzly,
but it was the next worse thing&mdash;an unusually
large, dark-brown bear.</p>

<p>"Duck!" counseled Private Overton,
promptly wheeling about. "Slip in a ball cartridge
as you run!"</p>

<p>Nor did Noll lose any time in following the
advice, for the brown bear was now in swift
pursuit, growling ominously.</p>

<p>Somehow, it didn't seem easy to slip in a ball
cartridge while they were running at top speed.</p>

<p>"There's a ledge. Get in behind it, and I'll
follow, Noll!" shouted Hal, crowding his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
bunkie toward the ledge.</p>

<p>Down behind the ledge dropped both bunkies.</p>

<p>There was an opening in the rock of some sort
behind them, but in their haste neither young
soldier stopped to look at it.</p>

<p>Hal had succeeded in slipping a cartridge
into his rifle. Noll did that, and also fixed his
bayonet at the muzzle of his piece.</p>

<p>Bang! went Hal's gun, but he had "bear
ague."</p>

<p>"Missed him, Noll! Take quick, sure aim!"</p>

<p>But at that instant another hoarse growl
sounded behind them, and Private Terry could
fairly feel his hair rise under his campaign
sombrero as he yelled:</p>

<p>"Here's another coming at us in the rear,
Hal! Must be the old female bear!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>BEARS AND OTHER TROUBLES</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>OR was there any doubt about the correctness
of Noll Terry's guess.</p>

<p>He had only time to back against the
ledge when the bear from the rear, uttering a
nasty, growling snarl, leaped straight for him.</p>

<p>But Noll had braced the butt of his rifle
against the ledge, the bayonet up.</p>

<p>It was no plan on Terry's part. He did it
either instinctively or through sheer luck.</p>

<p>In the meantime the male bear, showing two
fearsome rows of teeth, was crawling over the
ledge from outside to get at Hal Overton.</p>

<p>Let it be frankly stated, Hal's teeth were
almost a-chatter. He was scared all the way
through, but he did not lose his head.</p>

<p>Shooting back the bolt of his rifle, he reached
for another cartridge.</p>

<p>He had already used one, and only six to a
man had been issued on this period of field
duty.</p>

<p>There was no time to slip in the cartridge.
Overton was compelled to leap up straight and
club his gun.</p>

<p>Thump! Down came the butt of the weapon
with a force that would have cracked the skull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
of a man.</p>

<p>But bruin merely stumbled.</p>

<p>Just then another thump sounded, followed
instantly by a snarl of pain.</p>

<p>The she bear had sprung straight for Noll,
but rifle and bayonet were in the way.</p>

<p>Noll held his gun rigidly, though not by calculation.
All but frozen with terror he would
not have been capable of action.</p>

<p>So the flying bear struck squarely against the
bayonet, hurling herself with her whole weight
and momentum against the point of the steel.</p>

<p>But the bayonet did not touch a vital spot.
There was still a big amount of fight left in the
she bear.</p>

<p>As she lurched backward the huge beast
almost jerked the rifle out of Noll's hands, for
the bayonet was still deeply embedded.</p>

<p>At the instant of clubbing his gun Hal had
had his cartridge in one of his hands.</p>

<p>Now young Private Overton loaded faster
than ever he had been able to do in drill.</p>

<p>Bang! The sharp report rang almost deafeningly
in the narrow confines at the mouth of
the cave back of the ledge.</p>

<p>Hal had shot his bear, though he had not inflicted
a mortal hurt.</p>

<p>But bruin backed off, snarling, desiring to
study the scene for a second or two before deciding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
on further attack.</p>

<p>That nearly stunning report had the effect
of bringing Noll to his senses. He had a cartridge
in his chamber. Cocking the piece, he
pulled the trigger feverishly.</p>

<p>He inflicted another wound on the she bear,
though he did not put that maddened animal
out of business. Yet the beast drew back so
sharply that Private Terry was able to free
his bayonet from entanglement.</p>

<p>"Fix your bayonet, Hal, if you have a
chance," shouted Noll Terry, as he now leaped
gallantly after the maddened animal that was
claiming his attention.</p>

<p>Hal did, not a moment too soon, for now bruin
was at him again.</p>

<p>Two quick, sharp thrusts Hal made, the first
just as bruin was rising on his hind feet to advance
to hug the young soldier.</p>

<p>The second thrust tapped bruin on the left
shoulder just as he sank to all fours.</p>

<p>Then Private Overton turned sick again, as
he saw the dripping fangs of the beast come
closer.</p>

<p>Darting back a dozen feet, Overton, in frantic
haste, jammed in his third cartridge.</p>

<p>"Steady, boy!" he urged himself. "This is
for your life!"</p>

<p>Bruin made a spring. The muzzle of the rifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
was not four feet from the male bear's heart
as Hal Overton pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>That was the end of bruin. The beast fell
and rolled over on his side.</p>

<p>Like a flash Hal turned to see what help his
bunkie needed.</p>

<p>Plenty of it, apparently, for Noll, crowded
back to the wall, was making furious drives
with his bayoneted gun in his efforts to keep
the she bear from leaping and forcing him down
to the ground.</p>

<p>Hal had to think like lightning.</p>

<p>He decided on a cartridge.</p>

<p>Slipping back his bolt, and thus ejecting the
cartridge shell in the chamber, Overton jammed
fresh ammunition home.</p>

<p>Click! shot the bolt faintly.</p>

<p>Dropping to one knee, in the gloom Hal aimed,
as nearly as he could judge, just behind the left
fore-shoulder of the she bear. Then he pulled
on the trigger just as the she bear sprang at
Noll Terry.</p>

<p>At the report the she bear toppled over with
a grunt of pain. Noll leaped forward, thrusting
his bayonet time after time.</p>

<p>Private Overton, clubbing his rifle, delivered
several forceful whacks over the head of the
expiring animal, which then lay quiet.</p>

<p>"We've settled their case, Noll," Hal remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
in an awed voice.</p>

<p>"Glad of it," quoth Noll dryly.</p>

<p>To their ears now came a whining further
back in the cave.</p>

<p>"More bears?" asked Noll grimly. "If so,
I'm in favor of sounding a retreat."</p>

<p>"And I'll be with you," agreed Soldier Hal.
"But wait a second. I've a box of blazer
matches with me. First, slip all your cartridges
into your magazine."</p>

<p>Both soldiers did this. Then Hal, striking
a blazer match, led the way back into the
cave.</p>

<p>"Poor little beggars," he muttered suddenly.
"I thought so."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Noll, stepping forward.</p>

<p>"Look."</p>

<p>"Cubs!"</p>

<p>"No wonder the old she bear was savage,"
glowed Noll.</p>

<p>On a rude bed of dried leaves and twigs tumbled
five furry, fuzzy, whining little bear cubs.</p>

<p>"We've broken up a family's happiness this
night," muttered Hal, looking down.</p>

<p>"Well, it was their family, or two bunkies,"
retorted Noll, nevertheless feeling almost
ashamed as he bent down over the innocent,
harmless, bereaved little cubs.</p>

<p>"Shall we put 'em out of their misery?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
asked Hal.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I haven't the heart to."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm afraid I haven't that kind of
heart, either. But, see here, Noll!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"We're in the heart of the enemy's country.
If one of C Company's scouting detachments
comes this way I don't want them to find the
two dead bears and take 'em away in triumph.
It would be treason to our own B Company to
let C Company come in for an unearned feast on
nice, juicy bear steaks."</p>

<p>"That's so," agreed Noll.</p>

<p>"Help me, and we'll drag both carcasses back
into the extreme inner end of the cave. Then,
if Captain Cortland approves, he can send men
here and it will be B Company that'll feast on
bear steaks."</p>

<p>Both bunkies worked industriously until this
task had been accomplished.</p>

<p>"Speaking of bear steaks," announced Hal,
"makes me realize that I'm famished myself.
Now, as we're clear off the trail of B Company&mdash;and
that's no dream&mdash;we'll have to put
in the night finding our comrades. So a
few minutes spent munching hardtack won't
count."</p>

<p>"And not forgetting the salted almonds we
bought in the village this afternoon," rejoined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the other young soldier.</p>

<p>Down on the floor of the cave the bunkies
squatted themselves.</p>

<p>The work of eating absorbed both for the
next few minutes.</p>

<p>Then, of a sudden, they halted, astonished.</p>

<p>Human footsteps sounded on the rocks outside.</p>

<p>Privates Overton and Terry stopped their
eating, neither venturing to speak, for a voice
outside was saying:</p>

<p>"Sergeant, instruct the men not to light fires.
They'll have to sup on hard tack alone to-night.
Fires would betray us to the enemy."</p>

<p>Then Hal placed his mouth close to Noll's
ear and whispered:</p>

<p>"Bunkie, we're pickled!"</p>

<p>Noll pressed his comrade's arm understandingly.</p>

<p>"Pickled and sealed in jars," Hal's whisper
continued. "C Company is camping here, and
we'll be prisoners inside of a minute. And,
great Scott&mdash;C Company eats the bear steaks!"</p>

<small>IN THE MIDST OF THE "HOSTILES"</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was a pretty fix, indeed!</p>

<p>"Confound that lying old hunter down
at the cabin!" ground Noll wrathfully behind
his teeth.</p>

<p>Then both bunkies from B Company held their
very breath.</p>

<p>Out beyond the ledge, near the mouth of the
cave, a figure paced. Hal, as his eyes became
accustomed to the darkness, was sure that this
man was Captain Freeman. Just a little later
the young soldier was sure of it, for another
figure approached and saluted.</p>

<p>"Captain, I have to report that I have placed
the guard as you directed."</p>

<p>"That's Lieutenant Holmes. Pretty nearly
as fine a fellow as our own second lieutenant,
Prescott," thought Hal.</p>

<p>"You impressed upon each of the men the
cautions that I want observed?" queried Captain
Freeman.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Lieutenant Holmes,
"and I took the liberty of adding another caution
on my own account."</p>

<p>"What was that, Mr. Holmes?"</p>

<p>"I told each member of the guard, when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
left him, to look well to it that that young scout
of B Company, Overton, didn't get his rifle."</p>

<p>Captain Freeman laughed quietly, then
added:</p>

<p>"Overton is a very capable young soldier, Mr.
Holmes, and a good man in the service. But
just now, while these man&oelig;uvres are on, I'd
like to make a prisoner of him, I can tell
you."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you, though?" shivered Hal, listening
from where he crouched, while Noll
pressed his bunkie's arm again. "And I'm very
much afraid, captain, that you're likely to have
your wish!"</p>

<p>"Ah, here comes the other member of our
council. Good evening, Ray."</p>

<p>"Good evening, sir," replied the first lieutenant
of C Company.</p>

<p>"Ray," continued Captain Freeman, "we
were just discussing Overton, the scout of B
Company, who made off with the arms of our
outpost last night."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, we have some pretty fair scouts
of our own to-night," laughed Lieutenant Ray.
"I'd like to wager a month's pay that not a
soul of B Company knows where this command
is to-night. On the other hand, we know to a
dot where B Company is encamped."</p>

<p>"And we'll have the enemy potted by eleven
o'clock to-night," promised Captain Freeman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
in a tone of conviction. "But that's the least
we're obliged to do after the disgraceful treatment
that we had to stand last night. Unless
our scouts bring different word by half past
nine to-night, we'll slip in on 'em while they're
asleep, rush the sentries and have B Company's
camp for our own almost before the first blank
cartridge has been exploded. It's fine work to
roll in on your enemy and demolish him while
he's asleep and dreaming of home."</p>

<p>All three of the officers laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"Their camp is well chosen, too," continued
Captain Freeman. "In behind the rocks, just
the other side of the blasted twin oaks, makes
an ideal camp for a single company of infantry."</p>

<p>"By which route do you plan to approach,
sir?" asked Lieutenant Ray.</p>

<p>"Through the ravine from the east," replied
Captain Freeman, "for the simple reason that
Cortland would least of all expect an attack
from that quarter."</p>

<p>"It couldn't be better," declared Ray.</p>

<p>A fourth man now joined the group, saluting
all three.</p>

<p>"What is it, my man?" inquired Freeman.</p>

<p>"Supper is ready for the officers, sir."</p>

<p>"Very good, Stubbles. We'll come at once."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Stubbles was Captain Freeman's "dog-robber,"
or field cook, one of the privates of C
Company.</p>

<p>The steps of the departing officers soon quieted
down and ceased.</p>

<p>"Oh, Noll, we've got to get out of here now,"
breathed Private Overton in an agitated tone
in his bunkie's ear.</p>

<p>"Of course," retorted Private Terry. "We'll
get out by airship, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No joking, old fellow. We've simply got
to get out, and then we've got to run all the
way to the blasted twin oaks. You remember
the place?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," nodded Noll, though his bunkie
could not see his head in the deep darkness of
the interior of the cave.</p>

<p>"We've got to get there on the jump," Hal
whispered. "Not a minute to lose!"</p>

<p>"Regardless of the fact that C Company is
in camp all around us?" quizzed Noll.</p>

<p>"Noll, I tell you, we've got to get through
the lines at once!"</p>

<p>"Make a break and run for it, trusting to
luck and our ability to knock a lot of men
down?" queried Terry.</p>

<p>"No, sir! We've got to get out, and away
from here, without letting a soul from C Company
know that we've been within miles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
here to-night!"</p>

<p>"What nice, new problems you do put up!"
murmured Noll ironically. "What earthly
show, bunkie, have we to get out of here without
being seen?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we may be seen," admitted Hal, a new
and desperate scheme flashing through his
brain.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;&mdash;" began Noll.</p>

<p>"But not recognized, bunkie. See here, Noll,
I'm going softly down to the mouth of the
cave. From here you can see me, against what
light there is in the sky. Watch me. If I wave
my hand, come to me. Bring your rifle, too,
but unfix the bayonet and return it to your
belt."</p>

<p>"But what&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Noll, the company is at supper now. The
men have something especial to think of while
they're eating. If we just lounge through the
camp together, with our hats well forward over
our faces, and keep from going too close to
the groups, I don't believe any one will give
us any thought, or recognize us in the dark.
Understand, we'll just saunter until we get outside
the lines. Then we'll vanish and duck as
softly and swiftly as we can."</p>

<p>"By Jove, it's worth trying!" glowed Noll.</p>

<p>"Yes; because it's the only single chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
there is of our getting back to B Company in
time with the news. Wait&mdash;and watch!"</p>

<p>First Hal carefully took his own bayonet from
the muzzle of his rifle, returning it to place at
his belt. Then, on hands and knees, he crept
forward to the mouth of the cave, cautiously
peering beyond.</p>

<p>At last he signaled back.</p>

<p>In another moment Noll was by his side.</p>

<p>"Now, step out, old fellow," whispered Hal,
rising. "Don't betray any sign of trying to
escape attention. But, if you're spoken to, make
believe you don't hear. Keep up your nerve,
bunkie! This is real work for good old B Company
and victory!"</p>

<p>In another instant the two soldier boys
stepped carelessly out into plain sight, their
sombreros drawn well down over their eyes.</p>

<p>C Company was just ahead at supper. As
nonchalantly as possible the two young soldiers
of B Company began their leisurely stroll
through the "hostile" camp of C Company.</p>

<p>Could they hope to "get away" with this
daring trick?</p>

<small>PLANNING FOR THE NIGHT ATTACK</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>OR a distance of several yards the soldier
boys proceeded through the darkness
without appearing to attract any attention.</p>

<p>The officers and soldiers of C Company were
finishing their hasty, cheerless meal. There was
nothing strange about two soldiers having
finished ahead of the rest and deciding for a
stroll through the camp.</p>

<p>The darkness was the greatest protection of
our young friends. They refrained from going
very close to any group. Added to this, their
campaign sombreros were so well drawn down
over their faces as to hide a good deal of their
features, and this without exciting suspicion.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll were two thirds of the way
through the camp, when there came a sharp hail
that made Private Overton quiver inside:</p>

<p>"Hey, there!"</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that the hail was
intended for the soldier boys, though neither
gave any heed, even by as much as turning.</p>

<p>"Look out Overton, of B Company, doesn't
catch you!" jeered the same voice.</p>

<p>Noll threw one hand behind him, waving it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't go more than ten or twenty yards beyond
our lines, men," warned Captain Freeman,
looking up from the hard tack at which he had
been munching.</p>

<p>Hal wheeled about, saluting respectfully, but
did not trust himself to speak.</p>

<p>Then the chums continued their slow stroll.</p>

<p>Three minutes later they were just beyond
the edge of the camp, halting beside a bush.</p>

<p>"Here's our chance," whispered Hal, glancing
just past the roots of the bush.</p>

<p>A little gully started there. Twenty feet
further on it was more than six feet deep.</p>

<p>Hal passed around the bush, dropping into
the gully. In another moment Noll had leisurely
joined him.</p>

<p>Now, they traveled faster over the bed of the
gully, though they were careful to go cat-footed,
for they had yet to pass sentries, very likely
outposts, and there was a grave risk of their
running into some scouting detachment from C
Company.</p>

<p>The gully ran for some two hundred yards.
Then the soldier boys came out in the open once
more.</p>

<p>"More caution than ever now," whispered
Hal, detaining his bunkie by a strong grip on
the arm.</p>

<p>"We must be beyond their guard line," Noll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
returned in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it! Freeman isn't the
captain to maintain lax guard. Don't attempt
to stand up. Crouch low, and get all the cover
you can behind bushes. Better let me lead. I'll
halt often and listen."</p>

<p>With great stealth the pair had covered another
two hundred yards or so, when there came
a sharp hail of:</p>

<p>"Halt! Who's there."</p>

<p>The challenge had come from some one invisible
to the bunkies. Hal instantly and noiselessly
dropped to the ground, lying as flat as
he could.</p>

<p>Noll imitated his example.</p>

<p>"Halt! Who's there?" came the insistent
challenge.</p>

<p>Then the lurkers heard a man coming toward
them. Neither dared stir, as the slightest noise
might prove enough for their undoing. It was
a desperate situation, at any rate, for it hardly
seemed possible that the sentry could fail to
come upon them.</p>

<p>But in another minute the sentry had halted.</p>

<p>"Huh!" the bunkies heard him mutter. "I
reckon I'm getting as nervous as a sick cat,
after what happened to Corporal Raynes's outpost
last night."</p>

<p>Then the lurkers heard the sentry slowly returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
to the point from which he had first
challenged them.</p>

<p>It was three full minutes ere cautious Private
Overton ventured to crawl away from the spot.
He crawled for more than a hundred and fifty
yards, too, ere he ventured to rise to crouch,
peering all around him. Then he nodded to
Noll, close behind him, and the bunkies proceeded.</p>

<p>It was not until they had made fifteen minutes
more of the most stealthy progress that Hal and
Noll began to feel really easy.</p>

<p>"Now, see here, bunkie," spoke Private Overton
at last, "we're not as well 'out of the woods'
as we might be fooled into imagining. I think
it is even dangerous for us to go together just
now. We might run into a scouting detachment,
lurking among the rocks, or behind bushes, and
get captured after all. Look hard through
the darkness. Do you see that massive,
peculiar formation of rock ahead? About
three quarters of a mile from here, I would
say."</p>

<p>"Yes; I remember noting it in daylight,"
nodded Terry.</p>

<p>"All right. You make a wide detour to the
left, and I'll do the same to the right. Go
cautiously every step of the way, and have your
eyes and ears open. Take your time. I'll meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
you there."</p>

<p>"But what's the good of doing that?" objected
Noll.</p>

<p>"Just this: If we go together we may run into
a superior force of the enemy and be captured.
If we go singly we won't both be caught by the
same force, anyway, and there'll be a chance for
one of us to get through to Captain Cortland
with the news. Left oblique for yours, Noll!
March!"</p>

<p>It was nearly fifteen minutes later when the
chums met at the spot agreed upon.</p>

<p>"Whew!" muttered Hal, halting, as he came
up and recognized his bunkie. "I guess we're
safely away now, Noll. That being the case, I
don't mind admitting to you that when we left
the cave and stepped out into the camp, I hadn't
a belief in the world, hardly, that we'd get
away with our strategy."</p>

<p>"Oh, my shoes!" winced Noll.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, except that they're full of sore
feet!"</p>

<p>"I've some trouble of that sort myself," Hal
grinned. "But we've got to forget all about
it until we get to the twin oaks. Forward,
bunkie!"</p>

<p>They traveled together, after that. An hour
later they heard the most welcome challenge in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the world:</p>

<p>"Halt! Who's there?"</p>

<p>The speaker belonged to a B Company outpost.</p>

<p>"Friends," replied Private Overton.</p>

<p>"How many friends?"</p>

<p>"Two."</p>

<p>The sentry spoke something in an undertone.
Then, after a brief pause, he continued:</p>

<p>"Advance two friends, but two only, to be
recognized."</p>

<p>As the bunkies came up they saw Corporal
Cotter and two privates eyeing them.</p>

<p>"Oh, if it's the kid soldiers, they're all
right," spoke Corporal Cotter easily.</p>

<p>"Corporal," begged Hal, "show us the quickest,
easiest cut to camp. I've news for Captain
Cortland."</p>

<p>"Been scouting some more?" laughed Cotter.</p>

<p>"My news, Corporal, is for the company commander."</p>

<p>"That's all right, kid. See the grove
yonder?"</p>

<p>"Surely."</p>

<p>"Right in the middle of that you'll find the
tent of the company officers. They're asleep, I
guess. Sergeant Hupner is commander of the
guard, and Lieutenant Prescott is officer of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
day."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Corporal."</p>

<p>"Proceed!"</p>

<p>Two minutes later the bunkies were halted
by one of the camp sentries. Then they hurried
direct into camp.</p>

<p>At a distance of some twenty yards young
Lieutenant Prescott was found seated on the
ground, talking in low tones with Sergeant
Hupner. The young West Pointer leaped
quickly to his feet when he saw the soldier boys
approaching.</p>

<p>"Sir," announced Hal, saluting, "we report
our return to the company."</p>

<p>"You've completed this afternoon's duty?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;and much more."</p>

<p>"How more?" queried Lieutenant Dick Prescott,
eyeing them closely.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, we desire, sir, to speak with
Captain Cortland at once."</p>

<p>"It's as important as that?" asked Prescott.</p>

<p>"Judge for yourself, sir. We have just returned
from C Company's camp, and we've
heard Captain Freeman and his officers discussing
the plan by which they expect to attack
this camp to-night and bag B Company whole
hog."</p>

<p>"You've been to C Company's camp?" repeated
Lieutenant Prescott, eyeing the rookies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
closely. "Wasn't that exceeding your instructions
by a very wide margin?"</p>

<p>"We didn't go there by design, sir. It's a
long story."</p>

<p>"And you do well to remind me that I am
wasting time in not calling Captain Cortland,"
continued the young lieutenant. "Wait here,
men."</p>

<p>It was barely more than a minute when Lieutenant
Prescott came back with Captain Cortland
and Lieutenant Hampton.</p>

<p>"What's this I hear, Overton?" demanded
B Company's commander. "C Company expects
to bag us here to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>Hal briefly sketched the plan, as he understood
it, of attacking the camp by moving up
through the ravine.</p>

<p>"We've a sentry down at the ravine," declared
Captain Cortland. "But, Mr. Prescott,
I believe you would do well to rouse enough
men to create an emergency outpost beyond the
other end of the ravine. Also send a small
scouting detachment out considerably beyond
the ravine. But instruct the scouts to be
prepared for a quick recall at any moment."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott saluted his superior officer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
then hastened away to rout out the needed
men and post them.</p>

<p>"Go on with your story, Overton. Better give
it all to us in order, but be brief in the telling,
my man."</p>

<p>So Hal plunged promptly into the narration
of what he and Noll had been through, beginning
with the false scent on which they had
been sent by the hunter at the cabin.</p>

<p>Captain Cortland held out his hand almost
impulsively, both to Hal and to Noll.</p>

<p>"My men," he said earnestly, "I must tell
you that I believe you both did wisely in adopting
the profession of arms. Obedience is the
first requisite of the soldier. The records of
both of you stand well in that respect. But
scouting work, which comes under the head
of the service of information and security, is of
the utmost importance in a campaign, and you
two show positive genius as scouts. This is
all of a piece with your great work of last night,
Overton. I shall not forget it. As every man
will be called within fifteen minutes, you may
remain here under Sergeant Hupner's orders.
Mr. Hampton, you and I will take a brief stroll
and decide swiftly upon what we are to do."</p>

<p>"Lads," broke in Sergeant Hupner, as the
officers strolled away, "either you're mighty
lucky or else you're born soldiers. I believe it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
is the latter."</p>

<p>Five minutes later the two senior company
officers returned.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Hupner, we are going to call the
men, but no bugle will be sounded," stated Captain
Cortland. "Rouse the remaining sergeants
first; then instruct them to rouse all
the men and with great quietness."</p>

<p>B Company was soon aroused; in ten minutes
more all of the guard except the soldiers
down by the ravine had been recalled.</p>

<p>"We won't strike our tents," Cortland informed
his sergeants. "It will do no harm to
leave the camp standing, especially if the
enemy's commander uses his night glasses at a
distance. He will feel certain that we are nicely
bagged. Now, pass the word, without loud
command, for the company to fall in."</p>

<p>Two minutes later, in single file, B Company
marched toward the ravine like so many unsubstantial
spectres.</p>

<small>TRAPPERS AND TRAPPED</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap2">"</span>H</span>ALT, who's there?"</p>

<p>A single sentry, just at the opening
of the ravine, called the challenge
in a low voice.</p>

<p>There was no response.</p>

<p>"Halt! Who's there?"</p>

<p>There still being no response, the sentry advanced
toward a line of bushes.</p>

<p>He stepped through, peering beyond.</p>

<p>Almost without sound four C Company men
leaped at the sentry, clutching him by the
throat and bearing him to the ground.</p>

<p>The captured sentry was able to make only
a low gurgling sound in his throat. His rifle
was snatched away from him. Working at
professional speed, the sentry was gagged
and bound, then tossed upon the ground
once more, while a C Company man sat upon
him.</p>

<p>"Now, take the word back, Daly," ordered
the non-commissioned officer in command of the
captors.</p>

<p>The sentry did not offer to struggle. It was
as though he feared physical punishment would
be inflicted upon him if he dared attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
make trouble.</p>

<p>Little did the exultant C Company men dream
that this solitary sentry was the only man on
guard duty for B Company. The fact was that
this sentry had been posted with explicit instructions
to allow himself to be captured without
making any outcry or firing his rifle.</p>

<p>Three minutes later the ground about the
captured sentry appeared to be covered with
dimly defined figures of advancing men&mdash;soldiers
in full field equipment.</p>

<p>It was C Company, advancing by column of
twos, with Captain Freeman and Lieutenant
Ray at the head, and Lieutenant Greg Holmes,
alertly watchful of the line, at the rear.</p>

<p>Into the ravine C Company advanced, moving
with barely a sound. It was Freeman's intention
to reform his men once they were through
the ravine and advance, yelling and firing, upon
a surprised camp.</p>

<p>The head, then the center of the line, slipped
into the ravine. At last the whole of C Company
was fairly within the ravine.</p>

<p>Nor did Captain Freeman have the slightest
idea of the many pairs of keen eyes that watched
the progress of his command from the tops
of the low walls of stone that bound the
ravine.</p>

<p>Above stood Captain Cortland, well concealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
in a bush, watching, revolver in hand.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>Captain Cortland fired his revolver into the
ground&mdash;the signal shot.</p>

<p>Instantly a tempest of firing broke loose. Men
stationed on either side, above the ravine,
poured down their rifle fire&mdash;of blank ammunition,
of course.</p>

<p>From the inner end of the ravine two squads
of men fired from behind hastily erected entrenchments.</p>

<p>"Sound the retreat!" roared Freeman, above
the din of the firing, in the ear of the bugler
at his side.</p>

<p>But with the first notes of the bugle a din
of reports and a belching of flame came from
other B Company men, now stationed at the
end of the ravine through which C Company
had just entered.</p>

<p>The ambuscade was complete. Under any
war conditions C Company was hopelessly engulfed,
and ready for complete slaughter.</p>

<p>Suddenly the bugler up aloft, stationed by
Captain Cortland's side, blew as though he
would blow his lungs out, the signal for "cease
firing."</p>

<p>Then the din of musketry died down.</p>

<p>"Captain Freeman," called Cortland, "I call
upon you to surrender your command. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
must realize that, under war conditions, you
have already lost nearly every man of your
force."</p>

<p>"I surrender my command," replied Captain
Freeman promptly. "As you say, Cortland,
you have us wholly at your mercy."</p>

<p>At the word, passed by their non-commissioned
officers, the wearied men of C Company
squatted on the ground.</p>

<p>"I take it I may go through the ravine to
your camp, Cortland," called Captain Freeman,
"now that we are harmless prisoners of war."</p>

<p>"Yes; you had better march your company
through into the open and we'll join you."</p>

<p>"Thank heaven the cruel war is over," muttered
a soldier in C Company, and a hearty
laugh from victors and vanquished answered
this sally.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the recent mimic combatants
were all together on the same ground.</p>

<p>But Captain Freeman was burning with curiosity.</p>

<p>"May I ask, Cortland," he demanded, "how
on earth you guessed our plans so well that
you had that trap spread for us?"</p>

<p>"I didn't guess your plans," smiled Captain
Cortland.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now!"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of guess about it, my dear Freeman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
I knew your whole plan for to-night."</p>

<p>"Knew it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You had scouts out, Cortland, who detected
our advance? From your knowledge of our
advance you cleverly guessed our plan?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! As I just said, I knew your plan,
and did not have to guess it."</p>

<p>"But how?" pressed Captain Freeman, still
disconsolate and much mystified.</p>

<p>"Indirectly, I had the plan from your own
lips. In other words, Freeman, scouts of mine
were in your camp at early dark to-night. They
heard you and your officers discussing the plan.
Then, very naturally, my scouts brought the
information to me."</p>

<p>"Scouts?" cried the bewildered commander
of C Company. "By Jove, I remember two men
who strolled down through my camp to-night.
I called to them to keep close to our lines."</p>

<p>"But they didn't," chuckled Captain Cortland
gleefully, "for those two men whom you
hailed happened to be my scouts."</p>

<p>Captain Freeman took two great, gulping
breaths in his sheer amazement.</p>

<p>"Cortland, now that the sham campaign is
over," he begged, "may I know who your
scouts were?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear Freeman. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Privates Overton and Terry."</p>

<p>"Overton!" gasped Captain Freeman, in deep
chagrin. "The clever young rascal who looted
my outpost last night?"</p>

<p>"The same."</p>

<p>Several of C Company's enlisted men were
within hearing.</p>

<p>Now, from one of these men, came the heart-felt
utterance:</p>

<p>"Hang that kid Overton!"</p>

<p>"Terry's just as bad," growled another C
Company soldier.</p>

<p>"Cortland," remarked C Company's chop-fallen
commander, "I congratulate you on having
two fine young soldiers in your company."</p>

<p>"I surely have," nodded Captain Cortland.
"I have already informed Overton and Terry
of my estimate of their abilities."</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later the reunited companies
of wearied officers and men slept side by side
under the stars of the Colorado sky.</p>

<small>THAT C COMPANY CORPORAL EATS CROW</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap2">"</span>C</span>OMPANY, halt!"</p>

<p>Then, just a little later:</p>

<p>"C Company, halt!"</p>

<p>The long, dusty line of khaki-clad soldiers,
at the word, dropped out of ranks, finding seats
on the ground near where they had left the
ranks.</p>

<p>Behind the men, now stopped, the wagon train
came up and also halted.</p>

<p>Not far from the head of the line that morning
stood the log cabin of the old-time hunter.</p>

<p>Though the military did not suspect it, a
sharp pair of old eyes peered out through a
chink in the cabin wall.</p>

<p>Then the cabin door opened, the old-time
hunter sauntering slowly forth.</p>

<p>At sight of him Corporal Raynes, C Company,
tried to shrink into smaller space than he had
ever succeeded in occupying before.</p>

<p>"Which side won the tom-fool match?" inquired
the aged hunter of a pleasant-faced
young man on whose shoulders glistened the
plain straps of a second lieutenant.</p>

<p>"B Company won the miniature man&oelig;uvres
by capturing C Company, if that's what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
mean, sir," replied Lieutenant Dick Prescott
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"B Company?" cried the old man almost indignantly.
"Why, B Company stood for the
Japs, didn't they!"</p>

<p>"Not that I've heard, sir," answered Prescott.
"B Company and C Company represented
two forces that were supposed to be hostile to
each other. Neither side was designated by
the name of any country."</p>

<p>"Why, that's dinged strange!" uttered the
old hunter. "A lot of your camp wagons went
by yesterday, and there was a feller from one
of 'em, who told me he belonged to C Company,
and that C Company was supposed to be the
Americans, and B Company was the Japs. Now,
I've always hated the Japs!"</p>

<p>"Did you ever see any Japanese, sir?" asked
Lieutenant Prescott.</p>

<p>"Nope, young man; but what's that got to
do with hating 'em? Well, as I was saying,
that C Company feller on one of the wagons told
me about B Company being the Japs, and he
asked me if I would like to help along the licking
of B Company. So I done the best I
could."</p>

<p>"By sending two young B Company soldiers
across the wilderness, to that elevation over
yonder?" inquired Captain Cortland, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
heard the conversation.</p>

<p>"The C Company feller told me that it would
help lick the company that was standing for
the Japs," explained the old man, his face an
interesting study as he gazed from one officer's
face to another.</p>

<p>Captain Freeman had not yet heard the story
of how Hal and Noll had come to be in his
camp at dark. He had been denied that knowledge
by the laughing officers of B Company.
But Freeman had been near enough to hear the
hunter's explanation, and now C Company's
commander thought he saw a whole lot of sudden
light.</p>

<p>"Pass the word for Corporal Raynes!" he
shouted.</p>

<p>Raynes heard, and shivered. Yet he was a
soldier; there was but one thing to do. Quaking
in his restored shoes, Raynes rose and
marched briskly forward, halting and saluting
before his captain.</p>

<p>"Is this the man who was on one of the
wagons, and who told you to send two B Company
men hiking across a wilderness of rock?"
asked Captain Freeman.</p>

<p>"That's the very man," declared the old
hunter.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll had been looking on from a
little distance. Now they caught Captain Cortland's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
signal to come up, and obeyed.</p>

<p>"Are these the two young men you sent, sir,
on that wild-goose chase off over the rocks?"
asked Captain Freeman, pointing over towards
the bunkies.</p>

<p>"They sure are," nodded the hunter.</p>

<p>Captain Freeman turned, fixing the quaking
Raynes with a glance that brought the victim
scant comfort.</p>

<p>"Corporal Raynes, you were despoiled by
Overton while on outpost night before last.
Then, yesterday afternoon, you fixed up a practical
joke on Overton and Terry in order to
pay Overton back for his conduct to you the
night before?" queried Captain Freeman.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," admitted Raynes, feeling as
though he would like to sink about a mile into
the ground.</p>

<p>"Corporal Raynes," continued his captain,
half scathingly and half quizzically, "you have
proved a most valuable man to your company
during this period of field duty. First, while on
outpost duty, you allow yourself to be despoiled
of your rifle, shoes and canteen. Then, in your
humorous efforts to get even, you perpetrate a
near-joke that sends the enemy's two best
scouts where they will be right on hand to learn
our plans and betray us to the enemy. Corporal
Raynes, you have covered yourself with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
glory indeed! Return to your company."</p>

<p>Like wildfire the story spread down the line.
Raynes had to endure jeering looks from nearly
two hundred men.</p>

<p>"Ain't it fearful how these kids gain glory
from the very things that other folks do to
smash 'em?" demanded Private Bill Hooper
hoarsely in the ear of Private Dowley.</p>

<p>"It's a long lane of luck that has no turning,"
growled Dowley.</p>

<p>"After what I've seen of their luck, I'm
almost afraid to put up any job against 'em,"
confessed Hooper.</p>

<p>"You never did have much sand or wit, I
reckon," snarled Dowley.</p>

<p>"Are you still going to try to bring the kid
soldiers to disgrace?" asked Hooper in an eager
undertone.</p>

<p>"If I do, I don't believe you'll be much help."</p>

<p>"But I'd like to know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bill Hooper, if I need your help in anything
I'll be sure to let you know."</p>

<p>"Now, Dowley, you needn't be so warm-tongued
about it," urged Hooper. "Of course,
if there's any safe scheme for fixing the records
of these kids, I'm plumb crazy to have a hand
in it, and that you know, Dowley."</p>

<p>"Did the last thing we put up&mdash;spoiling Kid
Overton's rifle&mdash;get traced back to us?" demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Dowley.</p>

<p>"Now, that scheme didn't work much trouble
to the kid," complained Hooper. "He was in
bad for half a day, then got a new rifle, and
has been receiving bouquets ever since."</p>

<p>"You wait&mdash;watch and listen," urged Dowley.
"You won't be very much older when
you'll hear something drop that'll fix Overton
if he happens to be around."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd tell me," half whined Bill
Hooper.</p>

<p>"I will, if I want your help," remarked Dowley
dryly.</p>

<p>"Well, so long as the kid is chased out of
this regiment, I don't care who does it."</p>

<p>"Fall in!" rang down the line.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I'm glad I know who put up that job on
us," laughed Private Overton, as he stepped to
his place in ranks.</p>

<p>"But I wonder how it feels to be Corporal
Raynes just now?" hinted Private Terry facetiously.</p>

<p>"I hope he won't get reduced to the ranks
as a consequence," observed Hal.</p>

<p>"That would he rather rough. But I don't
believe Captain Freeman will do anything like
that."</p>

<p>Just before noon the troops were halted, then
marched, by companies, into a field. The order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
to pitch camp was given.</p>

<p>It was really too bad, but one of the wagons
drove up and the men on it began to unload
bear carcasses. All this bear meat was dumped
before B Company's line. C Company men
tried not to look in that direction at all, for
C Company's share in the bear meat was to be&mdash;none.</p>

<p>Early that morning Captain Cortland had
sent the wagon and men to recover the bear
carcasses from the cave. The bears had been
promptly "skinned" and dressed before loading
them into the wagon.</p>

<p>From still another wagon sounded the whines
of the five cubs. These were to be taken back
to Fort Clowdry, there to be fattened and
served at the coming Thanksgiving or Christmas
dinner of B Company's men. A few months
later these cubs would be "a good size for killing."</p>

<p>"To the victors belong the spoils." The two
older bears had been killed as already related,
and the cubs found by B Company scouts within
C Company's "territory."</p>

<p>Out were tumbled the Army cookstoves. Men
of B Company cut up the meat. Soon the odor
of baking and roasting meats was on the air.
Other willing helpers to the cook were trimming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
off pieces of meat for broiling.</p>

<p>It was torment to hungry C Company men
to smell the appetizing odors and to meet the
grins with which B Company men favored
them.</p>

<p>B Company must wait a while for its dinner,
but was willing. The men of C Company,
to stop, as far as possible, the pangs of longing
and the watering of mouths, fell to at once to
cook their own monotonous bacon.</p>

<p>"See here, Freeman, there's going to be an
abundance of bear meat," remarked Captain
Cortland, going over to his fellow company commander.
"Your men may as well have some of
it."</p>

<p>"Not under the circumstances under which
the meat was obtained," replied Captain Freeman
firmly. "Let the men of my company realize
that they were disgracefully worsted, and
that they have no cause for complaint."</p>

<p>So the men of one company sat down to a
meal of hard tack, bacon and coffee, while B
Company men waited for a better feast.</p>

<p>At last B's spread was ready.</p>

<p>"My man," said Captain Cortland to his
dog-robber, "cut off some nice pieces of bear
meat and take them over to the officers of C
Company with my compliments."</p>

<p>But the dog-robber soon returned, bearing
the platter on which the meat still lay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Captain Freeman's compliments, sir, but he
says that the officers of C Company will endure
a deserved disappointment along with their
men."</p>

<p>Ere B Company's feast ended a commotion
started that appeared to come from behind C
Company's street.</p>

<p>Hal, dropping his ration plate to the ground,
leaped up.</p>

<p>"Look, Noll!" he called laughingly. "Corporal
Raynes is certainly 'getting his.' Wow!
Look at the fracas!"</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Raynes, at this moment,
was being made the recipient of most unwelcome
attentions.</p>

<p>He was being tossed in a blanket.</p>

<p>This is the most emphatic and picturesque
way that soldiers have of displaying their displeasure
against a man. It is a torment that
is also inflicted on any soldier who is accused
of being "too fresh."</p>

<p>Eight soldiers had hold of an ordinary army
blanket, holding to it by the edges.</p>

<p>Several other soldiers had started in pursuit
of Corporal Raynes. Though that non-com ran
for all he was worth, he was captured, overpowered
and dragged to the blanket.</p>

<p>Willing hands caught him up, throwing him
into the slack of the blanket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Heave her, boys!"</p>

<p>Instantly, before Raynes could scramble to his
feet and escape, the slack blanket was hauled
taut.</p>

<p>Up into the air some four feet shot Corporal
Raynes's sprawling figure.</p>

<p>Down he came again, into the slack, but just
as promptly he was tossed again. This time
the victim went up more than five feet into the
air.</p>

<p>"Stop it!" gasped the victim from up in the
air.</p>

<p>But no one was in a mood to stop it. Higher
and higher shot the body of the unpopular corporal,
until he was going up ten feet or more
at nearly every toss.</p>

<p>It is a most ludicrous punishment to look at,
but the victim of this strenuous prank feels that
it is more than ridicule. He is always certain
that an outrage is being carried on against him.</p>

<p>"Sto-o-op it!" gasped Raynes weakly.</p>

<p>Under the merciless tossing and consequent
jolting nearly all the breath had left his body.</p>

<p>"Give him a few more tastes," advised three
or four of C Company's men who stood in the
front rank of those looking on.</p>

<p>Of course it was a breach of discipline, in a
way, for privates to toss a non-commissioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
officer, but neither Captain Freeman nor either
of his lieutenants interfered. The non-com is
not always safe, by any means, from blanket
tossing.</p>

<p>At last, however, the blanket was dropped to
the ground, and Corporal Raynes, breathless and
very red-faced, was allowed to roll off the woolen
surface.</p>

<p>As the corporal lay on the ground one of
the men voiced the feeling of all his comrades
in C Company by muttering grimly:</p>

<p>"Put up jobs that supply B's men with fresh
meat and leave us out, will you?"</p>

<small>THE CALL TO DEADLY WORK</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>OR the next three days the men were to
remain at the present camp.</p>

<p>Instruction in the erecting of temporary
field fortifications was to follow.</p>

<p>But Hal and Noll missed the first afternoon
of this work, for they were sent over to Mason
City as orderlies to Lieutenant Prescott, who,
as acting commissary officer to the reunited companies,
went to buy fresh foodstuffs.</p>

<p>Two wagons were also dispatched, the young
lieutenant riding with the driver on one of the
wagons, while the soldier boys rode on the other
wagon.</p>

<p>Mason City nestled in among the mountains
in what was considered one of the best health
sections of Colorado. The "city" would have
been termed a village back in the east. It contained
four hotels, two sanitariums, a small theatre
and other public buildings. It was to this
town that many eastern consumptives came.</p>

<p>The native population of the town was less
than a thousand souls. Consumptives and other
travelers added a usual average of about eighteen
hundred more people.</p>

<p>The streets were lively with people when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
two wagons drove into the town.</p>

<p>"You men may just as well enjoy yourselves
for a couple of hours, for I shall be busy in
looking through the markets," announced Lieutenant
Prescott, as the soldier boys climbed
down from their wagon. "Report to me at the
Mason House at six sharp. Remember, won't
you, that's it a soldier's business to be punctual
to the fraction of a minute?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Hal Overton, as the soldier
boys saluted.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott strode off down the street,
a splendidly military figure in his officer's khaki
uniform which, despite the hardships of the last
days, he had kept almost immaculate.</p>

<p>"A mighty fine young officer," murmured
Noll, gazing admiringly after the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"One of the best that they turn out of West
Point, I reckon," replied Private Overton.</p>

<p>Then the two young privates devoted themselves
to sight-seeing.</p>

<p>Punctually at the moment, however, both were
in the lobby at the Mason House.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott stepped in at the same
moment.</p>

<p>"I'll register you here for a room to-night,
men," he said, returning their salutes. "You
will also have your evening meal in the dining
room. I shall not need your services until morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Report to me at this spot at 8.30 to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," replied both soldier boys,
once more saluting.</p>

<p>"Say, a hotel meal will seem like a real luxury&mdash;what?"
breathed Hal.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it's ready?" murmured Noll.</p>

<p>"We'll find out."</p>

<p>The dining room was open. After going to
the wash room, and making themselves as presentable
as possible, the two young soldiers
stepped into the dining room, the head waiter
showing them to seats.</p>

<p>"There's the lieutenant over there at another
table," whispered Noll.</p>

<p>"I guess he's as glad as we are to have a
civilized meal again. But has it struck you,
Noll, that the government does things in pretty
good shape when it pays for putting up two
private soldiers at a fine hotel like this?"</p>

<p>What neither soldier boy suspected was that
Lieutenant Prescott was paying the bill for them
out of his own pocket&mdash;this as a silent remembrance
of their work in bringing victory to B
Company.</p>

<p>By the time that the meal was nearly over the
soldier boys observed that a man who looked as
if he might be a native of Mason City had seated
himself at the same table with Lieutenant Prescott,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
and was engaged in earnest, low-voiced
conversation with that young officer.</p>

<p>Soon after a waiter came to the table where
Hal and Noll sat.</p>

<p>"The lieutenant wants to speak with you as
soon as you have finished," announced the
waiter. "Don't go to him until you're through
eating, though."</p>

<p>Noll finished his last few bites of dessert, Hal
his coffee. Then both young men rose, quietly
crossing the dining room. The soldier boys, as
they moved with erect carriage and easy motion,
were full of a soldierly grace of appearance that
they did not begin to suspect.</p>

<p>Nor did they imagine that strangers in the
hotel dining room were paying any heed to them
until they heard a man's voice say approvingly:</p>

<p>"Regulars."</p>

<p>"Yes; they're the real thing," agreed another
male voice. "You'll know a regular wherever
you see one. The men of the regular Army
can't be beat."</p>

<p>"You sent for us, sir?" asked Hal, pausing
beside the lieutenant's table and saluting.</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Prescott. "Follow me from
the dining room. I have something to say to
you."</p>

<p>Prescott and the stranger passed out ahead.
Hal and Noll kept in their wake, about fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
feet to the rear. Lieutenant Prescott and the
stranger entered an elevator, the soldier boys following.
The young officer led the way to his room.</p>

<p>"Now, then," resumed Prescott, wheeling
about on the soldier boys, "I have had a very
peculiar request made to me to-night&mdash;by this
gentleman."</p>

<p>The stranger nodded.</p>

<p>"Mason City," continued the lieutenant, "is
usually a very orderly place. There are only
two policemen here&mdash;a night and a day officer.
Besides, there is one peace officer&mdash;Deputy
Sheriff Coates. Now, it happens that Coates is
ill in bed, and his physician absolutely forbids
him to leave his bed inside of a week."</p>

<p>"That's right," nodded the stranger.</p>

<p>"And the policemen are needed on the street.
Besides, I am informed that the two local policemen
are neither of them quite the sort of
men who are fitted for some work that has come
up."</p>

<p>"Also quite right," nodded the stranger.</p>

<p>"Therefore," went on the young lieutenant,
"Deputy Sheriff Coates, hearing that soldiers
are in town, has sent to me asking my help in
arresting one of the most dangerous characters
at present at liberty anywhere in the United
States. Now, if I am to undertake this work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
I must have assistance. The question comes,
men&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott paused, scrutinizing
keenly the faces of the soldier boys.</p>

<p>"Are you men ready to aid me in arresting
this desperate character, who is as deadly as a
rattler, and always ready to turn himself loose
with a pair of guns?"</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, sir," replied Hal, saluting,
"that the lieutenant should feel it at all necessary
to ask the question."</p>

<p>"I am obliged to ask you," answered Prescott,
"and also to inform you that you are both
at liberty to refuse, for this is not legally the
duty of a soldier under the circumstances. You
may refuse without subjecting yourselves to
criticism."</p>

<p>"But we have no thought of refusing, sir,"
Hal answered, not even considering it necessary
to glance at his bunkie. "We'll follow the lieutenant
anywhere, and do anything that he directs."</p>

<p>"But, my men, you and I may all three of us
be killed in this enterprise."</p>

<p>"Fearful, sir!" replied Noll half dryly. "Yet
I've always supposed it part of a soldier's duty
to be killed at need."</p>

<p>"In the discharge of military duties, yes,"
agreed Lieutenant Prescott. "But this is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
military duty in any sense. If you go into it
you must understand that you are acting voluntarily,
to aid the civil authorities of this state
and county."</p>

<p>"May I ask a question, sir?"&mdash;from Hal.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the young officer.</p>

<p>"You are proposing to risk your life, aren't
you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then we'll take the same risk, sir. We don't
need to ask anything more. Lead us where
you wish, and into what you please, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you, men," acknowledged Lieutenant
Prescott heartily. Then, turning to the
stranger, he added:</p>

<p>"I told you I didn't think I was mistaken in
these men."</p>

<p>"You certainly are not," agreed the stranger.</p>

<p>"Now, for the next step, I must wire the regimental
commander, Colonel North, asking his
permission that these men and myself engage
in the enterprise. I anticipate the colonel's consent.
Therefore, as soon as I have sent the
telegram, sir, you may lead us to the house of
Coates."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott then left the room.</p>

<p>"I suppose you boys wonder who I am?"
smiled the stranger.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," Hal replied quietly.
"When the lieutenant wants us to know he'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
tell us. No offense intended, sir."</p>

<p>"Nor any taken," replied the stranger, with
a laugh. "You regulars surely do go along,
just sticking to orders, and not caring for anything
outside of orders."</p>

<p>Second Lieutenant Prescott soon returned to
the room.</p>

<p>"I've sent my wire, Mr. Dent. Now we are
at your disposal. Lead the way, sir."</p>

<p>As the soldier boys followed their officer, a
dozen feet to the rear, from the hotel, they certainly
felt far more curiosity than they would
have admitted to any one else.</p>

<small>THE APPOINTMENT WITH SUPREME DANGER</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap2">"</span>Y</span>OU think you can manage it?" asked
Deputy Sheriff Coates anxiously, after
a long talk by the side of the sick
bed.</p>

<p>"I am sure we can," nodded Lieutenant Richard
Prescott cheerily.</p>

<p>"I hate to ask such favor of you," went on
Coates in a tone of real regret. "But Jack
Blick simply has to be arrested, and there
doesn't seem any other way."</p>

<p>"Don't worry any more about it, Mr. Coates,"
urged the young lieutenant.</p>

<p>It seemed odd to see one as young as Prescott
using this soothing tone to the weather-tanned,
middle-aged peace officer who, for a score of
years, had been known as a terror to evil-doers.
But Coates was flat on his back now, and there
was a man to be captured who was known as
one of the most dangerous men in the country.</p>

<p>During the conversation Hal and Noll had
remained seated at some distance from the bed.
The soldier boys had listened, but had said nothing.
Nor had Dent, who turned out to be the
local postmaster, said much, either.</p>

<p>"Blick is just waiting for a letter that holds
money to take him somewhere else," Coates continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
plucking at the bed clothes. "If he gets
that letter in the morning, he'll be out of sight
and away before I can get help here. As I've
told you, the stage comes here only twice a week,
and it is out of the question to get real help
through in case Blick makes his last trip to the
post office to-morrow morning. If he gets a
letter then, and finds the expected funds in it,
it's my belief that he'll be on his way among
the hills five minutes afterwards. That is, of
course, Lieutenant, if you're not there to stop
him."</p>

<p>"If he appears and is recognized, we'll stop
him," smiled Lieutenant Prescott with the confidence
of a trained man who cannot admit defeat.</p>

<p>"But be mighty sure you get the drop on
Jack Blick, Lieutenant. If you soldiers make
the slightest blunder after Blick knows you're
there for him, he'll drill all three of you. If
you once let Blick get a gun out of his pocket
then one or two of you will die&mdash;sure. The fellow
is as quick as lightning, and he always shoots
to kill at the first shot!"</p>

<p>"I have heard of that kind of man before,"
replied Mr. Prescott composedly.</p>

<p>"Don't you doubt that they exist, either, Lieutenant,"
warned the deputy sheriff earnestly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
"Don't forget, either, that Jack Blick is the most
dangerous man of that type."</p>

<p>"What a pity you don't know where Blick
is staying," sighed Lieutenant Prescott regretfully.
"It would be much more to my liking to
turn him out of bed in the middle of the night."</p>

<p>"None of us have been able to find the least
trace of his stopping place," put in Postmaster
Dent. "Not that we haven't tried. Wherever
Blick's hiding place is, it's a secure one."</p>

<p>The plans for the attempt at capture were then
made and fully discussed until every one present
understood fully.</p>

<p>Jack Blick, "wanted" for two killings and
half a dozen train and stage holds-ups, was here
in Mason City in disguise. He had always been
smooth faced, but now he wore a heavy beard.
He had made other alterations in his appearance.
At the post office he inquired for letters
for Arthur Dade. As a part of his disguise
Blick pretended to be a consumptive, and on even
rather warm days, he appeared in a light top-coat.
This was the information that Coates gave
Lieutenant Prescott.</p>

<p>"That's so he can carry revolvers in either
side pocket; don't forget that," urged the
deputy sheriff. "Watch Blick's hands when he
takes 'em out of his pockets."</p>

<p>Blick's identity had been learned from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
police of San Francisco. In that latter city
Blick's sister lived. It was believed that she
might correspond with her brother, and so the
police of San Francisco had arranged with the
local post office people for a chance to inspect
the address of every letter that Juliette Blick
mailed. These addresses had been run down,
and the one at Mason City had proved to be
the correct one for her brother.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you have tired yourself out,
Mr. Coates," suggested Prescott, rising. "As
we now know all that can help us, I propose
to leave after sending your nurse in to you."</p>

<p>"My nurse?" cried the deputy, almost resentfully.
"Me, under a nurse's care, when there's
a job at hand like catching Jack Blick!"</p>

<p>"We'll do our very best, sir, to take your
place," promised Lieutenant Prescott. Then
a new thought coming to him, he added:</p>

<p>"I think, Mr. Coates, perhaps we had better
wait until Mr. Dent goes down to the Mason
House to see whether there is an answer to the
telegram I sent Colonel North. I may have to
see you again, just for a moment."</p>

<p>Once outside the sick room, the three soldiers
stepped into the little parlor of the house.</p>

<p>"As postmaster, Mr. Dent, you are well
enough known to have no difficulty in getting
the hotel people to hand you any message that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
may have come for me."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Dent left them.</p>

<p>"Seat yourselves, men," urged Lieutenant
Prescott, himself dropping into a chair. "Now,
I think that, with three of us, we're going to
have a rather easy time to-morrow if Blick really
shows up at the post office. Of course, now that
we've undertaken this thing, we simply can't
allow ourselves to make any flukes."</p>

<p>"As I understand it, sir," smiled Hal Overton,
"any mistakes that any of us make will
form the basis of the undertaker's bill to our
families at home."</p>

<p>"That's the best possible way of stating the
case," laughed the young lieutenant lightly.
"Just for the sake of being able to remain in
the good old service we've got to avoid making
any bad breaks while Blick is at hand."</p>

<p>Thirty minutes went by ere the postmaster
of Mason City returned.</p>

<p>"Had to wait. Message just came. I brought
it at once," explained Dent, whose breathing
showed that he had hurried.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott took the little yellow envelope,
breaking it open.</p>

<p>"Pardon me for reading it," he said.</p>

<p>Then a smile broke over his features.</p>

<p>"It's O. K.," he announced, dropping the paper
to his lap. Then he picked it up again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
saying:</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>This was the dispatch that he read, addressed
to himself and signed by Colonel North:</p>

<p>"Permission granted to yourself and Privates
Overton and Terry to make arrest if possible,
but only after all three have been legally
sworn in as special deputy sheriffs of the county.
Obey and submit to the civil authorities in every
way."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" Hal could not restrain himself
from saying.</p>

<p>"What a bully old colonel commands 'Ours,'"
breathed Noll Terry.</p>

<p>"Ours" is the term given his regiment by
every soldier, whether officer or enlisted man.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see, men, that you're pleased.
Now, as I thought might be possible when leaving
Mr. Coates, we shall have to see him again
for just a moment."</p>

<p>"To be sworn in as special deputies?" inquired
Postmaster Dent.</p>

<p>"Exactly," nodded Lieutenant Prescott.</p>

<p>They were soon again at the sick man's bedside,
the young officer explaining their errand.</p>

<p>"Hold up your hands, all three of you," directed
Deputy Coates.</p>

<p>Then and there he swore them in formally
as special deputy sheriffs in the service of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
county.</p>

<p>"Dent, go to the third drawer in that cabinet
and take out three badges, will you?" asked Mr.
Coates.</p>

<p>"These badges will be in the best place if
we pin them to our flannel shirts, and then button
our blouses over them," suggested Prescott,
setting the example.</p>

<p>"I'll go out ahead of you now," proposed the
postmaster. "Arrange to be in the little alley-way
back of the post office at half past six in
the morning."</p>

<p>"Six thirty to the minute," Lieutenant Prescott
promised.</p>

<p>Once outside, the lieutenant told the bunkies
to return to the hotel together. Then he left
them.</p>

<p>Just on the dot of 6.30 the next morning Lieutenant
Prescott and his two soldier boys were
at the meeting place.</p>

<p>Postmaster Dent was ahead of them, and
quickly admitted them through the rear door of
the post office building.</p>

<p>"Now, we've just time to hurry into readiness,"
whispered Dent, rubbing his hands.
"The office opens sharp at seven!"</p>

<small>MEETING BLICK IN EARNEST</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap2">"</span>A</span>NY mail for Sarah J. Campbell?"</p>

<p>"I'll see, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Be quick, boy. I'm in a dreadful
hurry."</p>

<p>Noll turned away from the window to consult
a frame of boxes that were alphabetically
arranged.</p>

<p>"Maria A. Bampole, did you say, ma'am?"
sounded young Terry's voice, his face just out
of sight.</p>

<p>"No; I didn't," snapped the woman. "Sarah
J. Campbell, blockhead!"</p>

<p>"'Scuse me, ma'am," returned Noll politely,
though heavily.</p>

<p>The impatient woman could hear him slowly
sorting over letters.</p>

<p>"Nothing for Blockhead," he announced
slowly, as though talking caused him pain.</p>

<p>The woman threw up her hands in huge disgust.</p>

<p>"Sarah J. Campbell!" she insisted snappishly.</p>

<p>"Oh, 'scuse me, ma'am. I thought you said
Blockhead."</p>

<p>"So I did, dunce, but I was calling you that!"</p>

<p>"But, you see, ma'am," drawled Noll, exasperatingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
"I ain't looking for any mail."</p>

<p>"Then you'd better!" warned the woman
angrily. "And look for Sarah J. Campbell. Be
lively about it, too."</p>

<p>Noll ran through the letters and postcards in
Box C with provoking deliberation. Then he
announced, while the woman drummed impatiently
on the window ledge:</p>

<p>"Here's a postal from the Mason City
Laundry, stating that your wash, this week, will
be delivered only on payment of your account."</p>

<p>"Gimme that card," screamed Miss Campbell.
"I didn't ask you to read it, booby!"</p>

<p>"And here's another, from Medella, dealer in
false hair at Denver, stating that your order will
be shipped on the second of next month,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>People waiting in the line behind began to
titter, while Miss Campbell's face turned scarlet.</p>

<p>"Gimme my mail, stupid!" commanded Miss
Campbell irately. "And I'll complain to the postmaster
about your impudence."</p>

<p>Noll Terry gazed at the woman with an expression
of sadly wounded innocence.</p>

<p>"'Scuse me, marm, and please don't blab to
the P. M. This is my first day here. I'm new
and green, yes, marm, but I'm trying to be as
obliging as I can."</p>

<p>"Humph!" muttered the woman. Gathering
her post cards, she fled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott, holding one hand over
his mouth, used the other to beckon as soon as
he could catch Noll's eye.</p>

<p>Noll went over to him, saluting, out of sight
of any one at the post office window.</p>

<p>"Cut out some of this comedy, Terry,"
begged the lieutenant in a whisper, "or I shall
laugh outright and betray myself."</p>

<p>Noll once more saluted gravely, then returned
to his post at the general delivery window.</p>

<p>All traces of the military had left Noll Terry's
appearance. His khaki uniform was hidden under
the jumper and overalls that Postmaster
Dent had loaned him. Even his erect carriage
had vanished. Noll now looked as though he
had been round-shouldered from the cradle. His
crisp speaking tone had given way to a drawl,
and his look was stupid.</p>

<p>The three soldiers were alone in the general
delivery room, Noll the only one of them at any
time visible.</p>

<p>Toward the front of the room was a door
opening out on the lobby of the post office. Behind
this stood Lieutenant Prescott in uniform,
but without his sword. Over the right hip
dangled a holster in which lay a service revolver,
ready for instant work.</p>

<p>Further down the general delivery room, on
the other side of the window, was a door opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
also into the lobby. Behind this Private Hal
Overton, also in uniform, was stationed. He,
too, wore a revolver in holster over his right
hip, for the bunkies, when sent into town as
orderlies, had been armed with revolvers, as
is the custom in the case of officers' orderlies
in the field.</p>

<p>Noll's revolver lay on a little shelf out of
sight under the window ledge.</p>

<p>Over two hours had dragged by. There could
be no telling, of course, at what time Blick would
appear, even if he came at all.</p>

<p>It was not long ere Noll Terry forgot Lieutenant
Prescott's warning, and again started in
to have more fun with the people before the
window.</p>

<p>This time, however, he took great pains not
to let the young lieutenant catch his eye.</p>

<p>Then, of a sudden came a jolt that would have
made a less self-possessed young man topple
over.</p>

<p>A mild-eyed man of forty took his place before
the window. Noll barely glanced at the
fellow until the latter inquired in a soft voice
that was almost effeminate:</p>

<p>"Any mail for Arthur Dade?"</p>

<p>But Private Terry never turned a hair.</p>

Fray.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>This man was bearded and surely must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Jack Blick, he of the deadly habits.</p>

<p>"What name did you say?" queried Noll
slowly.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott and Hal Overton got out
their revolvers in a jiffy, each standing with
hand on the knob of a door.</p>

<p>"Arthur Dade," repeated the mild-voiced one.</p>

<p>"Bade?" blundered Noll purposely. "Will
you please spell it?"</p>

<p>"D-a-d-e, Dade, Arthur Dade," said the man
before the window.</p>

<p>"I'll see," nodded Noll coolly. He stepped
back, running through the letters in the D box.
There was a letter there, as Noll Terry knew
well enough. It had come in the mail that morning,
and was postmarked at San Francisco.</p>

<p>Presently Noll came back into sight with the
letter, holding it out with his left hand, while,
with his right, he leaned over to replace the
other letters in D box.</p>

<p>"Can you reach it?" invited Noll.</p>

<p>The man who had given the name of Dade
made the effort to reach the letter, which was
just what Noll was trying to make him do. That
move would keep one of the desperate fellow's
hands away from his weapons for a second or
two.</p>

<p>Two doors opened like a flash. Lieutenant
Prescott and Private Overton were darting on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
tip-toe into the expected fray.</p>

<p>"Blick, get your hands up&mdash;high! Get 'em
up quick, or take lead!" ordered Lieutenant
Prescott imperiously. "Don't try any tricks!"</p>

<p>Reaching his man at a bound, the young Army
officer thrust his revolver squarely up against
the fellow's breast.</p>

<p>"Great Scott, mister, don't shoot!" yelled the
stranger in a quavering voice.</p>

<p>"Then up with your hands, Blick!"</p>

<p>As though in terror the stranger had sprung
back two or three feet. This was done with the
quickness of a wildcat.</p>

<p>As a part of the same movement the desperate
man threw up one foot in a clever kick.</p>

<p>His heavy boot struck Lieutenant Prescott's
right wrist with fearful force, sending the pistol
flying and nearly breaking the young officer's
wrist.</p>

<p>Private Hal Overton had started at the same
instant, but he had further to go.</p>

<p>Blick's right hand dropped in a twinkling to
the right side pocket of his top-coat.</p>

<p>Both hands now flashed into sight, each holding
a revolver.</p>

<p>Coolly enough now, but with incredible swiftness,
the stranger aimed his left-hand weapon
at Lieutenant Prescott.</p>

<p>At the same instant Soldier Hal leaped from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
behind, wrapping both his arms around Blick's
neck and dragging him swiftly backward.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>The revolver was discharged, but the bullet,
owing to Blick's going over backward, struck a
wall.</p>

<p>Surely Blick must have possessed all the
strength and ferocity of the mountain lion.</p>

<p>Though Hal Overton thought he had his man
headed for a crashing fall to the floor, the fellow
managed to squirm out of that clutch as
though by magic.</p>

<p>Then Soldier Hal found himself staring into
both muzzles of the desperate fellow's pistols.</p>

<p>Hal knew it was time for him to shoot, but
found he was not as swift at the game as was
the justly dreaded Blick.</p>

<p>Bang-bang! sounded two loud reports. Two
streams of fire flashed before Private Overton's
eyes.</p>

<p>Two bullets all but grazed the soldier boy's
head on either side.</p>

<p>He would have been killed instantly but for
Lieutenant Prescott.</p>

<p>That young officer, afraid to fire for fear of
hitting his own man, had jumped into the fray
despite the fact that his right wrist was all
but useless.</p>

<p>With one flashing movement Prescott had recovered
his revolver with his left hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>It was his sudden football tackle, learned on
the gridiron at West Point, that had seized Blick
and spoiled the latter's aim.</p>

<p>Now, all three went down in an ugly clinch.
Officer and soldier were fighting to pin Blick's
arms to his side and thus render him helpless.</p>

<p>Bang! bang!</p>

<p>Bang! bang! bang!</p>

<p>To Blick it was little concern whether he lived
or died. If he must go under in the fight he
intended at least to do all the mischief he could.</p>

<p>So he fired, even while Prescott and Hal were
fighting desperately to pin his arms and spoil
his aim.</p>

<p>Fortunately, none of these five bullets did any
harm.</p>

<p>But the three locked together were fighting
like panthers.</p>

<p>If Blick could but wriggle out of the clutch
long enough to get either hand free, he would
stand a very good chance to kill one or both
of his assailants.</p>

<p>Neither the lieutenant or the soldier boy dared
fire in this scrambling clinch.</p>

<p>Each feared to kill the other.</p>

<p>Then Blick briefly got an arm free.</p>

<p>Bang! bang!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>THE BATTLE OF THEIR LIVES</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>T the first sign of trouble the few people
in the post office lobby had devoted their
entire energies to getting away.</p>

<p>Nor did any of the postal employs appear
to offer aid.</p>

<p>They had little stomach for such a deadly affair
as this was certain to be.</p>

<p>And Noll?</p>

<p>At the first note of Prescott's voice, as the
lieutenant leaped at Blick, Private Terry had
dropped below the level of the window ledge.</p>

<p>There his hand closed on his revolver.</p>

<p>With this in hand, he bounded for the door
that the young Army officer had left open.</p>

<p>But all this took time, and what was going
on in the post office lobby outside seemed to take
place in split seconds.</p>

<p>Noll had just bounded out in sight of the
scramble for life as Blick fired the last two shots.</p>

<p>Even as the wretch pressed the trigger, however,
Hal Overton took another quick grip on
the fellow's wrist.</p>

<p>Thus was the soldier boy's life saved for the
instant.</p>

<p>But the weapons that Blick carried were automatic
revolvers, each holding nine cartridges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
The scoundrel therefore held several lives in his
hands if he could only get a chance to free his
wrists sufficiently.</p>

<p>Still the three fought, rolled and scrambled
across the floor.</p>

<p>Now, Private Noll Terry was hovering over
the combatants.</p>

<p>At first the strenuous trio moved with such
bewildering speed and were so hopelessly mixed
up that Noll actually wondered what he could
do.</p>

<p>At last he saw his chance and tried for it.</p>

<p>Whack!</p>

<p>Clubbing his revolver, Soldier Noll brought
the butt of the weapon down with fearful force&mdash;on
some one's head.</p>

<p>By sheer good luck it proved to be Blick's
head.</p>

<p>Almost completely stunned, Blick rolled over
on his back, Lieutenant Prescott bearing down
on one of Blick's arms, while Hal Overton held
the other.</p>

<p>Leaping around, Noll thrust the muzzle of
his own revolver into Blick's mouth.</p>

<p>"Shall I pull the trigger, sir?" demanded
Noll coolly.</p>

<p>"No," responded Lieutenant Prescott with
equal coolness. "I think we have the rascal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
now."</p>

<p>Jack Blick came back to consciousness to see
his weapons go spinning across the floor in
different directions.</p>

<p>"Now, if he makes any further efforts at
trouble, Terry, just pull the trigger," directed
Lieutenant Prescott. "Blick, put your hands
in front of you, over your stomach."</p>

<p>Sullenly the fellow obeyed. Lieutenant Prescott
snapped a pair of handcuffs over the fellow's
wrists.</p>

<p>"Now, you'll keep without spoiling," predicted
the young Army officer, leaping to his
feet. "Pull him up, men."</p>

<p>Though his right wrist was swelling, Prescott
employed that hand to thrust his revolver
back into the holster over his hip.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll dragged Blick to his feet.</p>

<p>Like a flash the scoundrel darted away from
them. No one had told the Army people that
Jack Blick was an expert at throwing off shackles.
But now Blick squeezed his wrists and
hands through the steel bracelets before his
would-be captors could realize it.</p>

<p>As part of the same movement he raced to
where one of his revolvers lay.</p>

<p>Stooping and picking it up, Blick wheeled like
a streak of light on his knees.</p>

<p>But Soldier Hal had his own weapon up. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
fired, coolly&mdash;for life.</p>

<p>The bullet drilled through Blick's wrist, forcing
him to drop the revolver like hot iron.</p>

<p>The fellow's left hand, however, picked up
the weapon.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>Once more Blick dropped his weapon, for Noll
Terry had fired, shattering the fellow's left fore-arm.</p>

<p>Now, apparently, Jack Blick was out of the
fighting game.</p>

<p>But Lieutenant Prescott, who had just
snatched his pistol from its holster, dashed forward,
holding the muzzle of his weapon almost
in the fellow's face.</p>

<p>"Stop all nonsense, now, my man, or we'll
kill you without a word of parley," warned the
young officer in an even but deadly and convincing
tone of voice.</p>

<p>Hal slipped a cord from his pocket, knotted
a noose, and dropped it over the fellow's head,
drawing the noose tight.</p>

<p>"I think we can hold him this way, sir," Hal
suggested to the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Yes; get behind him, Overton. Let him walk
slowly, but don't stand for any bolt. You get
behind Blick, too, Terry, and hold your revolver
on his back. If he tries to bolt, or makes a
single hostile sign, shoot to kill. We're through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
with anything like nonsense."</p>

<p>With his uninjured left hand Lieutenant Prescott
helped the prisoner to the floor.</p>

<p>"Now march, my man," ordered the officer.
"Out into the street. Don't try to hurry,
either."</p>

<p>Thus they proceeded to the street, Lieutenant
Prescott with drawn revolver in his left hand
keeping just behind the soldier boys, and with
ever an eye of watchfulness on the prisoner's
steps.</p>

<p>Only six doors below stood the police station.
Thither they conducted Blick, and the solitary
day policeman of the little town, seeing the
crowd that had formed and followed, came rushing
to the scene.</p>

<p>"Get a doctor first," Lieutenant Prescott ordered,
when they had Jack Blick safely inside
the station house.</p>

<p>A physician was on hand inside of two minutes.
He washed and dressed the rascal's
wounds.</p>

<p>Then a blacksmith was sent for, and others
brought portable forge and bellows. An "Oregon
boot" was shaped and riveted to Blick's
lower left leg, and a red-hot piece of iron welded
on over the rivets.</p>

<p>This "Oregon boot" is a famous device in
some western states. It is simply an extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
heavy cylinder of iron. The prisoner who wears
it can barely draw his left foot along. Running
would be out of the question. Nor, when
the blacksmith's job was done, could Blick, even
had he been provided with ordinary tools, have
succeeded in getting that "boot" off his leg in
less than four hours.</p>

<p>The day policeman of Mason City, who was
also chief of the "force," swore in six armed
citizens as special policemen. They were to
watch the prisoner day and night until other
officers arrived to take him away to stand trial.</p>

<p>"I guess you'll keep now, won't you, Blick?"
asked Lieutenant Prescott, smiling in at the
prisoner, who lay on a bench behind the barred
door of a cell, his guards just outside.</p>

<p>"You think you got me, don't you?" jeered
Jack Blick harshly.</p>

<p>"I think we did," the young Army officer
agreed, smilingly. "Have you any doubts, my
man?"</p>

<p>"It took three of you to do it, and if there'd
been only two of you, I'd have gotten away,"
snarled the desperado.</p>

<p>"I'll admit that that is probably true," assented
Prescott, as smiling as ever. "Blick,
you're a nervy, deadly man. But fellows of your
class always ought to bear in mind that the
community is bigger than any one man can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
possibly be. You're caged now, and you have
always been bound to be, sooner or later."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you feel pretty big now?" sneered
Jack Blick.</p>

<p>"I can't say that I do," rejoined Lieutenant
Prescott coolly. "As nearly as I can judge,
I feel just about as big as I did yesterday, or
the day before. How about you, men?"</p>

<p>"I know very well that I felt a lot bigger
the day I first stepped into the uniform than
I do now," laughed Soldier Hal.</p>

<p>"I always feel largest on pay-day," smiled
Private Noll Terry. "And this is a long way
from pay-day."</p>

<p>"I've got friends in this town. Friends of
my own kind," broke in Jack Blick harshly.
"Don't forget that."</p>

<p>"Why?" queried Lieutenant Dick Prescott.</p>

<p>"Because," snarled Blick, showing his teeth,
"you've been marked by my friends already.
You won't get out of town and back to camp
alive!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>CAPTAIN CORTLAND "MAKES A SPEECH"</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap2">"</span>Y</span>OU heard Blick's declaration, didn't
you?" questioned Lieutenant Prescott,
with a smile.</p>

<p>He had halted on the sidewalk and was gazing
at his soldier boys.</p>

<p>"That we wouldn't get out of town alive,
sir?" asked Hal Overton.</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, men, we don't deserve to, either,
if we leave our comrades out in camp deprived
of fresh food much longer. It was Captain
Cortland's expectation that we would start back
by noon to-day, and now it's ten in the morning,
with four hours or more of real work ahead of
us, so we had better walk briskly to the market."</p>

<p>An officer does not, except in rare instances
that call for it, walk with his men. He walks
either ahead or behind them. This is not because
of any contempt or lack of respect, even, for
the men; it is a rule of discipline and is followed
for discipline's sake.</p>

<p>There was soon an abundance of hard work
to be done. Liberal supplies of fresh meat were
bought, and a considerable variety of groceries
and fresh and canned vegetables, for Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Sam's soldiers live well.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll soon discovered that they had
not been brought along as ornaments. They had
their hands full of work.</p>

<p>Then, at last, Lieutenant Prescott sent Hal
as messenger to summon the drivers to bring
the wagons over to pick up the supplies.</p>

<p>Hard as all hands worked, it was well after
one o'clock when the heavily laden wagons were
finally gotten into shape and headed out of
town.</p>

<p>"Overton?" called the lieutenant, just before
the start.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Hal saluted.</p>

<p>"Have you seen any assassins lurking about?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>Brief as his reply was, Hal stared at the
young officer in some astonishment.</p>

<p>"Have you seen any assassins dogging our
tracks, Terry?" was Lieutenant Prescott's next
question.</p>

<p>"No, sir," came from saluting Noll.</p>

<p>Then, continued the lieutenant, still speaking
gravely, "I think that this small United
States force may presume to start on its way.
Of course, we may run into an ambush within
the next thirteen minutes, but that would be a
mean trick to play on a military party."</p>

<p>Though the young officer spoke with all gravity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the soldier boys realized that he was wholly
in jest. Reinforced now by the soldier drivers,
who were also armed, this little party of trained
men could put up a very ugly point at the first
sign of need.</p>

<p>"And Prescott is just the sort of officer who'll
always know how to lead men in a scrap," Hal
thought admiringly.</p>

<p>"Shall we take our seats on one of the wagons,
sir?" questioned Private Noll Terry.</p>

<p>"No; the wagons are too heavily laden as it
is, and we've a rough road ahead. You'll march
on foot. Take the road just ahead of the
wagon train, but do not march under any restraint
whatever. Walk just as much at ease
as you can."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>Both soldier boys saluted and stepped ahead.
The wagons followed at once. The first time
that Hal and Noll glanced backward they saw
that Lieutenant Prescott was also on foot, walking
beside the second wagon.</p>

<p>"I don't believe Lieutenant Prescott ever
gives an order that he wouldn't want to follow
himself," murmured Hal.</p>

<p>"He's the real thing in the soldier line,"
responded Noll.</p>

<p>"I imagine that that other new West Pointer,
Holmes, is just as fine a soldier and officer,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Hal continued.</p>

<p>"Very likely," admitted Noll. "I hear that
they both came from the same home town, and
that Prescott and Holmes were chums even years
before they went to West Point."</p>

<p>To healthy young soldiers the walk, though
over rough roads for most of the way, was no
hardship. The wagon train reached camp later
in the afternoon, just as the hard-working regulars
in camp were coming back from drill in
constructing trenches with revetments. These
revetments are frames of one kind of wood or
another, so built into the trench as to increase
its stability greatly.</p>

<p>"You found that your task took longer than
you expected, didn't you, Mr. Prescott?" was
Captain Cortland's greeting when the young
officer, saluting, came over to report.</p>

<p>"We would have gotten through much earlier,
captain, but some of our time was taken up
otherwise."</p>

<p>"How was that?"</p>

<p>"We accomplished an arrest for the county, at
the request of the local deputy sheriff, sir."</p>

<p>Captain Cortland frowned slightly.</p>

<p>"Ordinarily, Mr. Prescott, that is no part of
a soldier's business. But I feel certain that you
must have had excellent reasons for acting before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
you had explained to me the circumstances
in the matter?"</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances, sir, as I had the
use of the telegraph, I found it much easier to
communicate with Colonel North at Fort
Clowdry."</p>

<p>"Oh, you did that, Mr. Prescott?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I trust that was not the wrong
course to take. I wanted to save time, and so
used the wire straight to regimental headquarters."</p>

<p>"That was perfectly proper, Mr. Prescott,"
nodded Captain Cortland. "So you had Colonel
North's permission to aid the county authorities?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; on condition that we acted as volunteer
county peace officers, and not as soldiers.
I have preserved Colonel North's dispatch, sir.
Here it is."</p>

<p>"Come over to the tent, Mr. Prescott. I am
anxious to hear about the whole affair."</p>

<p>As Captain Cortland listened to the young
officer's narration of what had taken place, he
opened his eyes a bit wider.</p>

<p>"Mr. Prescott, Overton and Terry seem, in
every way, to be proving themselves exceptionally
fine young soldiers."</p>

<p>"They are all of that, sir," assented Lieutenant
Prescott warmly.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Gray!" called the captain, thrusting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
his head outside the tent.</p>

<p>B Company's first sergeant stepped over, saluting.</p>

<p>"Sergeant, direct Overton and Terry to report
here at once."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Privates Hal and Noll appeared before the
door of the tent, saluting respectfully.</p>

<p>"Come in, men," directed the captain, and
the soldier boys entered the tent, standing at
attention.</p>

<p>"Men, Lieutenant Prescott has just been telling
me about the arrest in town. He speaks
most highly of the conduct of both of you this
morning."</p>

<p>Since this called for no reply, the two soldier
boys merely continued to stand at attention.</p>

<p>"Now, I'm not going to commend you for the
courage you displayed," went on B Company's
captain. "It is a soldier's business to be brave,
and he should never be commended for anything
less than the most distinguished bravery. But
what I am going to commend both of you for is
in the way of qualities that not all soldiers show
as successfully. The first is prompt obedience,
and the second is good judgment under conditions
of great danger and requiring the swiftest
action. I do not know, men, that I can make
my commendation duly emphatic in any other
way than by telling you that I am fully satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
with both of you as soldiers of real merit,
and that Lieutenant Prescott's report strengthens
my conviction. That is all. You may go."</p>

<p>Again Hal and Noll saluted, then wheeled and
stepped from the tent.</p>

<p>"That's a good deal better than a speech, isn't
it?" murmured Noll when the bunkies were
some distance from the officers' tent.</p>

<p>"Why, as coming from a captain, in praise of
his men, that was really a speech, wasn't it?"
asked Hal.</p>

<p>As neither of the young bunkies told the story
in camp, it got out only through the partial accounts
of the wagon drivers, who were able to
give only garbled and not at all accurate descriptions
of the exciting business of the morning.</p>

<p>"I hear you kids have been in the hero business,"
grinned Private Hyman, coming over to
the chums.</p>

<p>"You're a friend of ours, Hyman, aren't
you?" asked Private Overton, flushing.</p>

<p>"I surely consider myself one," replied Hyman.</p>

<p>"Will you do us a great favor?"</p>

<p>"You know I will, if I can."</p>

<p>"Then drop the hero business and forget all
about it," begged Hal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"I reckon I like you better for that," nodded
Hyman. "Lovely weather we're having, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Lovely air this afternoon," laughed Noll,
sniffing. "Just smell the odors coming from the
Army stoves."</p>

<p>"Now you're talking about your own exploits,"
teased Hyman. "You were on the detail
that went in after the fresh grub that's
going to make two hundred men, more or less,
extremely happy to-night."</p>

<p>"Attention, B Company!" called out Lieutenant
Prescott, stepping in among the groups
of resting soldiers. "I am directed by Captain
Cortland to state that, immediately after supper
to-night, twenty men of B Company may
have leave to visit Mason City. But they will
be required to be back here punctually at ten
o'clock to-morrow morning. Men who wish to
avail themselves of the proffered leave will see
Sergeant Gray without delay."</p>

<p>"Going in, Hyman?" asked Hal, as that soldier
turned to walk away.</p>

<p>"If I'm fortunate enough to get leave," nodded
Hyman. "There are several things I want
to do in town."</p>

<p>The supper that night was as perfect and as
hearty as the resources of camp permitted.
Some of the soldiers ate so heartily that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
were presently content to lie about camp for
the evening, and were glad they had not applied
for town leave.</p>

<p>Captain Freeman had allowed the same number
of his men town leave.</p>

<p>Just before dark forty United States doughboys
started down the trail, bent on pleasure
and sight-seeing.</p>

<p>Being on leave, none of these men were allowed
to carry their arms with them. Nothing,
for that matter, could be much more awkward
to a soldier than his rifle when on leave to visit
town.</p>

<p>"Be careful, men, that none of you overstay
your leave," Lieutenant Hampton called warningly,
as the town party started down the trail.</p>

<p>"We won't, sir," came the chorused answer.</p>

<p>This is always the promise of men on leave.
Sometimes, in the excitement of pleasures, the
promise is forgotten, or ignored, and then
trouble is sure to follow.</p>

<small>ROUNDING UP THE MISSING LEAVE MEN</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>AMP police, which means the care and
tidying of camp, and the carrying out
of hygienic precautions, occupied the soldiers
in camp most of the time between breakfast
and nine o'clock.</p>

<p>Then the toilers were dismissed for rest.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hampton," called Captain Cortland,
"you may notify Sergeant Gray that assembly
will sound at 10.15. Just before that, at 10.10,
roll-call of the men on town leave will take
place."</p>

<p>Some minutes before ten o'clock a lot of the
men of both companies began to straggle in.</p>

<p>"There will be some of the boys who won't
be here on time, though," Private Hyman confided
to Hal.</p>

<p>"A soldier who gets leave and doesn't respect
it is either a fool or too mean a shirker
to be in the service," Hal returned.</p>

<p>"That's what I tried to tell some of the fellows
in town," laughed Hyman lightly. "You
ought to have heard them thank me! But, oh,
what's the use? A fellow who is going to make
a good soldier of himself always does the nearest
he can to right, and the other kind seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
get back on a second enlistment, anyway."</p>

<p>A few minutes later Sergeant Gray's voice
could be heard calling:</p>

<p>"B Company men returned from town leave
fall in here for roll-call."</p>

<p>Further down the camp, C Company's first
sergeant could be heard giving the same summons.</p>

<p>Instead of twenty men, only fourteen of B's
fell in.</p>

<p>Sergeant Gray looked them over with disgust
written on his fine, bronzed, soldiery old face,
for Gray had served twenty-four years with the
colors.</p>

<p>Then he began to call the roll.</p>

<p>"Dismissed," he announced as soon as he had
finished reading.</p>

<p>Turning on his heel, a look of deep concern
on his face, Sergeant Gray reported to Captain
Cortland.</p>

<p>"Well, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"Six men absent from roll-call, sir."</p>

<p>"Who are the six men?"</p>

<p>"Burt, Coy, Dowley, Hooper, Landers and
Corporal Minturn, sir."</p>

<p>"Direct Sergeant Hupner to report to me at
once."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>Sergeant Hupner came up at a brisk stride,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
saluting.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," continued Captain Cortland, "I
am very sorry to say that six of B Company's
men have violated their pledge and have not
returned from leave. Doubtless all of them are
in Mason City at this moment."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Take a detail of six men, reporting their
names to Sergeant Gray, and start with as little
delay as possible for Mason City."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. May I ask a question?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"If I should meet any of the missing men on
their way back here shall I place them under
arrest?"</p>

<p>"If you find them at a greater distance than
one hundred yards of this camp, Sergeant, put
them in arrest and take them into Mason City
and back again with you."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"And don't allow any man to have any amusement
whatever in Mason City after you arrest
him."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"Lack of punctuality is a very serious military
offense, Sergeant. I shall do all that is
possible to stamp it out in B Company."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"That is all, Sergeant. You do not need any
further instructions, for you are an old soldier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and can be depended upon."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"Sergeant Gray will give you the names of
the delinquents."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>With a final salute Sergeant Hupner turned
and strode away. If his gait were any indication,
Hupner meant to capture every one of the
delinquents with the least possible loss of time.</p>

<p>"You want another trip to Mason City, Overton?"
queried Hupner, halting before the soldier
boy.</p>

<p>"Not for fun," replied Hal, "but I'll go there,
or anywhere else on earth, on a matter of duty."</p>

<p>"You're my man," nodded Hupner. "You,
too, Terry. Hyman, I guess you may have an
idea where some of the delinquents are holding
forth in Mason City?"</p>

<p>"I guess I know," nodded Private Hyman,
"though not from associating with any of
them."</p>

<p>Three other men were quickly detailed. While
the men of this detachment were arming themselves,
Hupner hastened to Sergeant Gray for
a list of the delinquents.</p>

<p>"Fall in. By twos right, march!"</p>

<p>Hupner led his detachment from camp, and
was nearly a hundred yards on his way when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the bugler blew the call for assembly.</p>

<p>A military commander, even a corporal or
sergeant, is expected to get his command in
action with the loss of not even seconds.</p>

<p>And a very business-like looking little force
this was. Not a man carried a rifle. Instead,
each man had drawn a revolver, which now
dangled in holster from his belt. Each soldier
also wore at the belt a pair of handcuffs, though
these would be used only on troublesome prisoners.</p>

<p>"Squad halt!"</p>

<p>The marching men were about a mile out of
Mason City when this command came.</p>

<p>Sergeant Hupner, in the lead, had caught a
glimpse of a sight that was soon after revealed
to the halted men.</p>

<p>Around a bend in the road, beside a jutting
piece of higher ground, lurched an unsteady
figure.</p>

<p>That figure, moreover, was clothed in the uniform
of the United States Regular Army, but
now the uniform was badly soiled and battered.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Coy?" sharply demanded
Sergeant Hupner.</p>

<p>The youth&mdash;he was barely more than twenty-one,
halted unsteadily, blinking at Sergeant
Hupner as though he were not sure whether he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
saw one, two or three sergeants.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" sternly repeated
Sergeant Hupner.</p>

<p>"Thash all (hic) right, Sarge," replied Private
Coy thickly.</p>

<p>He seemed in danger of losing his balance
as he stood there blinking.</p>

<p>"It's all wrong," snapped out Hupner
crisply. "Answer me. Where do you think
you are going?"</p>

<p>"Back to (hic) camp, Sarge."</p>

<p>"You're a disgrace to the uniform," rapped
out the sergeant. "You a soldier! You're not
even fit to be an anarchist! You miserable,
drunken disgrace to the uniform!"</p>

<p>"Oh, thash all (hic) ri', Sarge. Had bully
time. Now'm going back to camp."</p>

<p>"What you need is company, then," returned
Sergeant Hupner grimly. "Adams, fall out and
go back with him. If Coy gets too drowsy to
navigate you can wait here on the trail for us.
If he gets quarrelsome then put the bracelets
on him."</p>

<p>"Don' (hic) need no brashlets," asserted Private
Coy with great gravity. "I'm all ri'. Gentleman,
I am."</p>

<p>"Come along," ordered Private Adams,
though he spoke gently, as he took the unfortunate
lad's arm. "They're waiting for you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
now in camp."</p>

<p>Sergeant Hupner stood there in the trail, gazing
after Coy with a look of mingled contempt
and pity on his face.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven the good mother who reared
that weak piece of flesh isn't here to drop tears
over him now," muttered the sergeant. "Forward,
route step, march!"</p>

<p>People on the streets in Mason City gazed
curiously when they saw the little detachment
march in. Many of these people, when they
saw the revolvers and handcuffs at the soldiers'
belts, were able to make a good guess at Hupner's
mission.</p>

<p>So did several of the loafers of the town, who
make a business of guiding prospective victims
to saloons and other disorderly places.</p>

<p>Some of these members of the scum of the
town promptly slipped away to give warning in
the places where they believed or knew some of
the delinquent soldiers might be found at that
moment.</p>

<p>At the head of the main street of the town
Sergeant Hupner halted his command.</p>

<p>"Overton and Terry, fall out," commanded
Sergeant Hupner. "You men will start right
here, one on either side of the street, and visit
in turn each saloon on the street. You will also
look into any private rooms that you may find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
connected with these saloons. If you find any
of the missing men you will bring them out
into the street. Hyman, fall out. You will remain
in the street to receive and hold any prisoners
that Overton or Terry may bring to you.
Men, you are armed, but you will remember
that you are to use your weapons only in case
of dire necessity. Yet, at any hazard, you will
arrest and hold any man of B Company that
you find."</p>

<p>"Shall we arrest any of C Company's men
that we may find?" inquired Hal.</p>

<p>"You won't find any," replied Sergeant Hupner.
"All of C's town-leave men were back on
time. It's B that takes all the disgrace this
time."</p>

<p>For this important duty Sergeant Hupner had
chosen Hal and Noll, because he knew they
could be depended upon to enter saloons without
being tempted to buy any of the vile wares exposed
there for sale.</p>

<p>Moreover, they were both so staunch in their
principles that they could enter such places&mdash;on
duty&mdash;without being degraded thereby.</p>

<p>But, though both soldier boys searched saloon
after saloon, they did not seem destined to find
any of the delinquents. Private Hyman was
standing out in the street, with nothing to do.</p>

<p>"Some one must have spread the alarm,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
thought Private Overton. "Or else the men are
really not in any of these vile places. I hope the
last guess is the true one."</p>

<p>At last Soldier Hal came to the last resort of
the kind on his side of the street.</p>

<p>As he started to push open the door of this
place a big, broad-shouldered, red-faced man
stepped into the doorway.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing here, soldier kid," leered the
fellow.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but I didn't ask you," was Hal's
quick retort.</p>

<p>"Clear out! Hear? You can't come in here,
I told you."</p>

<p>"You're dealing with the United States Army
now, my man," Hal retorted coolly. "Out of
my way, if you please. I'm going inside."</p>

<p>"No, you're not."</p>

<p>"Out of my way was what I said."</p>

<p>"An' I said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The red-faced man didn't finish.</p>

<p>Private Hal Overton had drawn his service
revolver from its holster without the loss of another
instant.</p>

<p>It rested now with its muzzle poking against
the big fellow's belt line.</p>

<p>Gasping, he looked into the clear, cool eyes
of the young soldier boy.</p>

<p>Then, with an oath, the bully sprang aside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
and Hal stepped inside as though no interruption
had occurred, at the same time slipping his
weapon back into its holster.</p>

<p>The man who had stopped him was not, sometimes,
much afraid of revolvers. But he had
seen something in the glint of Private Overton's
eyes which had made him realize that the young
soldier would not tolerate any nonsense whatever.</p>

<p>As Hal stepped inside the place his gaze swept
around through the fog of the smoke-laden atmosphere.</p>

<p>It was a saloon of the worst description, as
was amply testified by the appearance of the
rough-looking customers there.</p>

<p>Overton was the only man in sight who wore
the United States uniform.</p>

<p>However, the soldier boy walked down the
length of the room, for it was within the range
of possibilities that a soldier starting in on a
carouse might first exchange his uniform for
a suit of civilian clothing.</p>

<p>Not a face in the assemblage was that of a
B Company man.</p>

<p>"The sneak!" Hal heard a voice say, and
knew that the epithet was applied to himself.
But he paid no heed.</p>

<p>"Club him," advised another.</p>

<p>"No wonder soldiers desert," growled still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
another sodden fellow, "when they send anything
like that, with a gun, after another soldier
that's out for a good time."</p>

<p>To not one man in the place did the clean-cut
face, the evident manliness and fine soldierliness
of Private Overton appeal. Hal was not of
their kind, and these creatures could not appreciate
the higher kind of manhood in this
young soldier.</p>

<p>"Ye may jest as well get out of here, kid
in brass buttons," jeered a voice behind the bar.
"None of yer crew are in here."</p>

<p>But Hal had halted before a door at the end
of the room, his hand on the knob.</p>

<p>"Here," yelled a voice, "don't you go in
there! That's my family's quarters. Private!"</p>

<p>But Soldier Hal, without replying, pushed the
door open and stepped over the sill.</p>

<p>He found himself in a short, narrow passage,
the only light coming from the room he had
just left.</p>

<p>Beyond was another doorway. Hal stepped to
that and turned the knob.</p>

<p>"Waiter!" hailed an impatient voice. "What
kept you so long?"</p>

<p>Two other men laughed coarsely, but in an
instant the laughter had died out of their voices.</p>

<p>Hal was in a room in the center of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
stood a table.</p>

<p>Gathered around that table, in a dense blue
haze that ascended from burning tobacco, sat
Corporal Minturn and Privates Dowley and
Hooper.</p>

<p>"Attention!" Private Overton rapped out
sharply. "You are all under arrest for over-staying
your leave!"</p>

<p>"Forget it, and get outside as quick as you
can," growled Private Dowley.</p>

<p>"You are all under arrest," Hal repeated
firmly.</p>

<p>With an oath Dowley leaped up, retreated to
the far end of the room and picked up a club.
With this in his hand, he wheeled about, glaring
angrily.</p>

<p>Corporal Minturn and Private Hooper were
also on their feet.</p>

<p>"Get out of here, you little tin soldier!"
roared the corporal, who appeared to have imbibed
more than either of his companions.</p>

<p>"Come, start, you kid gun-toter," insisted Bill
Hooper.</p>

<p>"Stop your nonsense, men," Hal replied, gazing
at them steadily. "I have told you that you
are under arrest."</p>

<p>"Floor him with that club, Dowley!" ordered
Hooper.</p>

<p>"Won't I, though&mdash;just!" retorted Dowley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
adding an oath as he leaped forward.</p>

<p>Soldier Hal knew that he had reckless men
to deal with, but that was no reason why he
should not do his full duty.</p>

<small>DOWLEY EGGS ON A CATSPAW</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>OWLEY, as he sprang forward, found
the muzzle of Private Overton's revolver
uncomfortably close to him.</p>

<p>"No nonsense," warned Hal. "I don't want
to hurt any one, but I'm here on duty."</p>

<p>Dowley eyed the soldier boy viciously for an
instant, then, with another oath, leaped forward.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>Private Overton fired without a second's delay,
though he did not shoot to hit.</p>

<p>Into the wood at the end of the room crashed
the bullet.</p>

<p>But Dowley, who had not believed that the
"kid soldier" would dare fire, dropped to the
floor.</p>

<p>"Get up," commanded Hal, eyeing him
closely.</p>

<p>"I'll suit myself," snarled the man on the
floor.</p>

<p>The firing had been plainly heard in the outer
room.</p>

<p>Two or three of the weaker-nerved patrons
out there promptly made a break for the street.
None ventured into that inner room. Corporal
Minturn and his companions must now take care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
of themselves.</p>

<p>But this, in their present ugly mood, they
seemed quite able to do.</p>

<p>"Don't act like a fool, Dowley," rasped Hal
impatiently. "The detachment is strong enough
to take you back, man, and you'll have to go
back in irons if you attempt to stir up trouble.
Get up!"</p>

<p>"Not to please you, though!" growled Dowley,
as he leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>He still retained his grip on the bludgeon.</p>

<p>"Drop that club," ordered Hal sternly.</p>

<p>"You clear out!"</p>

<p>"Drop that club!"</p>

<p>"Make me."</p>

<p>"You're determined to act foolishly, aren't
you?" demanded Hal with the ring of contempt
in his voice.</p>

<p>"I'm bound to do as I please," leered Dowley
viciously.</p>

<p>"You can't when you're in arrest," replied
Hal.</p>

<p>"But I'm not in arrest."</p>

<p>"I've already told you that you are," Hal
insisted coolly.</p>

<p>"I don't take my facts from a kid like you,"
sneered Dowley, edging closer.</p>

<p>"Get back!" warned Soldier Hal.</p>

<p>But Dowley, grasping the club tighter, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
a sudden lunge.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>Hal fired his second shot. Not even now did
he aim to hit. The bullet whizzed past Dowley's
left ear. But that fellow, who had seen the
quick pressure of Soldier Hal's finger on the
trigger, threw himself flat to the floor once
more, and this time the club rolled from his
hand.</p>

<p>"I mean business, and it will be better for
all of you to understand it," Private Overton
announced. "Get up, Dowley, and you three
men form in single file. Corporal Minturn, you
take the lead."</p>

<p>"I'll take it in another way," leered the corporal,
bending and snatching up the club.
"Hooper, you pin the kid's arms!"</p>

<p>Hooper made a move on Hal's other side.
The soldier boy had to dodge to avoid being
seized.</p>

<p>As he did so Dowley leaped up from the floor
to join in the attack from in front.</p>

<p>Again Hal Overton raised his service revolver,
though with no more intention than before of
wounding any of the ugly trio.</p>

<p>But Corporal Minturn, as his muddled brain
now figured it, had to strike in self-defense.</p>

<p>Whack!</p>

<p>It was a lusty blow, backed by venom and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
muscle.</p>

<p>Private Hal Overton simply crumpled up and
fell to the floor, motionless.</p>

<p>"You sneaking dogs!" rang Private Hyman's
scornful voice from the doorway. "Get your
hands up now, all of you, or there'll be some
real war!"</p>

<p>Backing Hyman, Noll Terry darted into the
room.</p>

<p>Hal's first shot had not been heard, but Hyman's
quick ear had heard the second.</p>

<p>Scenting trouble, in an instant Hyman had
summoned Private Terry, who just then appeared
on the street, and both had dashed into
this place.</p>

<p>"Get your hands up, all of you, before I shoot
fast and hard to square matters for the kid!"
Hyman now insisted savagely.</p>

<p>Noll got a glimpse of Hal lying on the floor,
and added savagely:</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm just itching for an excuse to shoot!"</p>

<p>There could be no doubt of the temper of these
newcomers. Danger partially sobered these
ugly ones. Up went their hands without further
delay.</p>

<p>"Put your hands down, just one at a time,"
continued Hyman. "Terry, you take Corporal
Minturn first and iron him."</p>

<p>Click! Snap! Minturn was in no position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
to do further harm.</p>

<p>It was Hooper's turn next. That big fellow
was utterly cowed and began to talk rather
whiningly.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!" commanded Noll
angrily.</p>

<p>Then he went over and ironed Dowley, who,
still sullen, was capable, while free, of becoming
suddenly more dangerous than either of his
companions.</p>

<p>"I reckon Minturn fixed your bunkie for good,
anyway. I hope he did," Dowley ground out
between his closed teeth.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I've got the handcuffs on you,"
flared Noll; "If your hands were free I'd enjoy
pounding you all over the floor!"</p>

<p>"Take off the links, then, and try it," sneered
Dowley.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, you dog!" barked Private
Hyman.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're a brave man, when you've got the
other crowd in irons," spat out Dowley sneeringly.</p>

<p>"I'm brave enough for you at any time,"
taunted Hyman. "This was your job"&mdash;pointing
to prostrate, unconscious Hal&mdash;"but you
egged another man on to do it, you cowardly
cur!"</p>

<p>"Is that so?" sneered Dowley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you know best," retorted Hyman contemptuously.</p>

<p>"You can watch 'em now for a minute," broke
in Noll. "I'm going to see if I can find Sergeant
Hupner. If I can't, I'm going to get the
first doctor I can."</p>

<p>"You can get doctors to burn," replied Hyman.
"This is a sanitarium town, and the pickings
here are fat for the medicos."</p>

<p>Noll ran through the larger room. The men
there turned to scowl at him, but Noll gave no
heed to any of them.</p>

<p>Out in the street, at a little distance, he saw
Sergeant Hupner and the two remaining men of
the detachment coming along with two soldier
prisoners.</p>

<p>Noll set up a shout. Hupner, espying him,
came on the run.</p>

<p>"Have you found any of the others?" demanded
the sergeant.</p>

<p>"We have all the other delinquents. But,"
choked Noll, "I'm fearfully afraid that Minturn
has done for Hal Overton for good."</p>

<p>"Where is Overton?" demanded the sergeant
swiftly.</p>

<p>"In a private room at the rear, Sergeant,"
Noll answered, pointing. "You can find the
way. I'm going to rustle for a doctor."</p>

<p>"Good boy," nodded Hupner, and darted into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the evil place.</p>

<p>Within three minutes Private Noll Terry entered
the place, followed by a keen-eyed young
physician.</p>

<p>Hal still lay unconscious on the floor, a bad
gap showing across the top of his head, and a
red pool on the floor near him.</p>

<p>Private Hyman was now kneeling beside the
young soldier, his eyes misty.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're here, Doctor," nodded Hyman,
speaking huskily as he rose. "I was just
going to try to do something myself, but was
afraid I might do the wrong thing."</p>

<p>"I didn't know what I was doing," muttered
Corporal Minturn weakly. "I wasn't responsible."</p>

<p>"Silence! Tell that to the court-martial,"
broke in Sergeant Hupner in a tone of sheer
disgust. "Be quick, Doctor, won't you? And
if there is anything that we can do to help you,
speak."</p>

<p>The young physician was now feeling the cut
on Hal's head, the skilled fingers glided easily
along the edges of the wound, pressing lightly
against the bones of the skull.</p>

<p>"This couldn't well be much worse," announced
the physician, looking up. "But before
I do much, or make a thorough examination, I
want this soldier in bed. Have you a surgeon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
at camp?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Sergeant Hupner.</p>

<p>"Then I'll get out my automobile and take
the young man up in the car, after washing the
cut and putting on a first bandage."</p>

<small>A DISPUTE IN THE GUARD HOUSE</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>F the ride that followed back to camp
Hal Overton knew nothing.</p>

<p>Noll Terry sat beside him, supporting
him.</p>

<p>Of course the automobile reached camp a long
time ahead of the detachment with prisoners.</p>

<p>Captain Cortland caught sight of the car and
came hastening to meet it.</p>

<p>Noll Terry leaped out, saluting.</p>

<p>"Sir, I have to report that Corporal Minturn
assaulted Private Overton, and that we called
in a physician, who has brought Overton out
here."</p>

<p>"How badly is Overton hurt?" demanded the
captain, hastening to the side of the auto.</p>

<p>"Badly," replied the physician. "Have you
any facilities here for the care of a man who
may have brain fever if he lives for the next
forty-eight hours?"</p>

<p>"We have a hospital steward and four hospital
corps men," replied Captain Cortland.</p>

<p>"And bandages and medicines?"</p>

<p>"An abundance of them."</p>

<p>"Then your soldier lad may have some show.
He'll no doubt be better off here than among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
strangers in town. When do you start back to
your post, Captain?"</p>

<p>"In the morning of the day after to-morrow,"
Cortland answered. "One moment, please. Sergeant
Gray!"</p>

<p>The first sergeant hurried up, saluting.</p>

<p>"Sergeant, send the hospital steward here.
Then see that a hospital tent is taken from one
of the supply wagons and set up at once and
make the patient as comfortable as possible."</p>

<p>Within ten minutes the tent was up, with a cot,
a table, two chairs, bandages, medicine chest and
other accessories.</p>

<p>Now, with the help of the steward, the physician
gave the injured soldier boy a very thorough
examination, washed the gash carefully
and bandaged it.</p>

<p>Directions were left with the steward, who
was a trained nurse, and then the physician returned
to town, after having been requested to
call again on the following day.</p>

<p>Hal Overton knew little, and that little in a
dreamy, disorganized way, even when his cot
was carefully placed and secured in one of the
transport wagons for the return to Fort
Clowdry.</p>

<p>The roughness of the first part of the ride
brought on mild delirium. Two days later, however,
after being placed on a cot in the military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
hospital at Fort Clowdry, Soldier Hal opened
his eyes with a keener realization of the world
about him.</p>

<p>"How do you feel, Overton?" asked one of
the hospital corps men, bending over him.</p>

<p>"Like a fool," sighed Hal.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"A youngster like me has no business wasting
time in hospital. Can I get out to-day?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," smiled the hospital corps
man.</p>

<p>"I'm not badly hurt, am I?"</p>

<p>"If the rainmaker knows his business, you've
had a fight for your life, and youth and a good
constitution have won out."</p>

<p>"How long am I to be here?"</p>

<p>"You'll be here for three or four days yet,"
answered the hospital corps man.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's about all the talking you'd better
try to do until the rainmaker has seen you,"
interposed the hospital corps man, and moved
away as he added:</p>

<p>"Either sleep, or just keep quiet."</p>

<p>But the next morning Hal was so much improved
that the hospital corps man took a chair
by the bedside.</p>

<p>"You may want some of the news, Overton,
about things that have happened while you've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
been here."</p>

<p>"I am just a bit curious," smiled Overton.</p>

<p>"Three of the delinquents got off with ordinary
summary court punishments&mdash;fines and
a little stretch at the guard house. But Minturn,
Dowley and Hooper are locked up there,
too, and they've got to wait and stand court-martial.
Their day in the Army is ended, I
reckon."</p>

<p>"It ought to be," nodded Hal. "They're no
good to the service."</p>

<p>Noll was allowed to come in for a few minutes
that afternoon.</p>

<p>Eight days passed ere Hal Overton was released
from hospital. Then the surgeon marked
him "quarters" on sick report, which meant that
Private Overton was excused from all duties,
and must spend his time in taking care of himself
only.</p>

<p>For four days he continued to be marked
"quarters," chafing all the time.</p>

<p>"There's a lot I've got to learn about the soldiering
business," he grumbled. "I haven't any
time to waste loafing."</p>

<p>"There's one soldierly duty you can learn
right now, then," smiled Soldier Noll quizzically.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"You can learn how to obey the rainmaker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
when you fall under his orders," replied his
chum indulgently.</p>

<p>"How does an impatient fellow learn that, I
wonder?" sighed Hal.</p>

<p>"Why, what are you kicking about?"
demanded Noll in pretended astonishment.</p>

<p>"You're surely not being overworked, and
you're getting in trim for the next work we
have cut out for us."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>"Why, the whole battalion, except for a small
guard squad from each company, is to be ordered
to the September encampment of the Colorado
National Guard. The regulars are to be
represented there by field artillery, cavalry, infantry,
signal corps men and engineer troops.
Hal, it's going to be great! There'll be more
than eight hundred regulars and two brigades
of militia in camp together."</p>

<p>"It won't do me any good," retorted Private
Overton cynically.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I'm just out of hospital, and I'll be stuck
on the home guard detail from B Company."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't believe that," urged Noll soothingly.</p>

<p>"Wait and see."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>There came a morning when Private Overton
marched over to hospital with the other men
on sick report.</p>

<p>"You seem to be doing pretty well now, Overton,"
remarked Lieutenant Gross, the surgeon.</p>

<p>"How are you going to mark me, sir, to-day?"
breathed Hal anxiously.</p>

<p>"Duty," smiled the rainmaker.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness," murmured the soldier
boy.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter with being marked
quarters, Overton?"</p>

<p>"Fine, for a loafer, sir, but I want to learn
the soldier business, and I haven't any time to
lose."</p>

<p>"From all I hear," remarked the rainmaker,
"you're learning the soldier business fully as
rapidly as you need to."</p>

<p>"There's a lot more I want to know, sir, and
it can't be learned when a man is marked 'hospital'
or 'quarters,' sir," Hal returned. "Thank
you for marking me 'duty.'"</p>

<p>"There's a real soldier, or I'm too green to
be an officer," thought Lieutenant Gross, as his
eyes followed Hal, who, erect and full of spring,
was striding from the room.</p>

<p>On the third day after his return to duty Hal
was warned for the guard. The following morning
he turned out to be inspected with the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
guard.</p>

<p>As he was not assigned to the first relief, Hal
seated himself inside the guard house, picking
up one of the books that rested on a table there
and began reading.</p>

<p>Presently the other soldiers sauntered outside,
and Soldier Hal was left there alone.</p>

<p>"Overton!"</p>

<p>Hal laid down his book, rising and stepping
over to a cell door to find Dowley's eyes glaring
at him balefully.</p>

<p>"You sneak, you're responsible for getting
me into all this trouble!" hissed the soldier in
arrest.</p>

<p>"Dowley, you know very well that the rules
forbid a member of the guard from talking with
a prisoner, except when the talk is strictly in the
line of duty."</p>

<p>With that Soldier Hal turned and went back
to his book.</p>

<p>"You could have gotten out of that place in
Mason City when I told you to," went on Dowley
hoarsely. "Then all that followed would
never have happened."</p>

<p>Hal went on reading.</p>

<p>"Say, Hooper," muttered Dowley aloud to
the man in another cell, "as a fresh kid ain't
that fellow the end of the world?"</p>

<p>"He's a boot-lick," jeered Hooper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"He just sneaks around the officers, telling
'em lies so as to get things easier for himself,"
broke in Corporal Minturn from still another
cell. For these three, unlike the ordinary run
of guard-house prisoners, had been placed in
separate confinement.</p>

<p>Hal read on, though the color mounted to his
cheeks.</p>

<p>"You dirty dog!" cried Dowley hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Lying sneak!" from Bill Hooper.</p>

<p>"Two-cent boot-lick!" was Corporal Minturn's
contribution.</p>

<p>Hal laid down his book, rose and stepped over
to where he could look at the three, one after
another.</p>

<p>"If you men don't hold your tongues," he
warned coolly, "I shall have to report you to
the corporal of the guard for abusive talk. I
don't want to do that, either."</p>

<p>"Oh, my, a little bit of authority!" sneered
Corporal Minturn.</p>

<p>"Tin general!" taunted Dowley.</p>

<p>"Go and boot-lick some more!" urged Bill
Hooper.</p>

<p>"Corporal of the guard!" summoned Soldier
Hal.</p>

<p>Corporal Sykes entered promptly.</p>

<p>"Corporal, these men in solitary are amusing
themselves by heaping insults upon me. I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
report them, Corporal, on account of personal
feeling, for they're down on their luck, and they
hold me responsible for it, as in a measure, of
course, I am. But I don't want to get on the
record for laxity while on guard."</p>

<p>"Quite right, Overton," nodded Corporal
Sykes. Then, turning to the three "solitaries,"
he demanded:</p>

<p>"Why are you prisoners guilty of insulting
and abusive language toward a member of the
guard?"</p>

<p>"He's too well satisfied with himself,"
sneered Bill Hooper.</p>

<p>"Ditto," scowled Dowley.</p>

<p>"What have you to say, Minturn?" demanded
Corporal Sykes.</p>

<p>"The kid just sat down there to make us
mad," replied Minturn in a growling voice.
"The sight of that boot-lick makes me sick all
over."</p>

<p>"That's all I want to know," replied Corporal
Sykes calmly. "You've all admitted the
abusive language, so I'll enter it on report, which
will be brought up at court-martial. If there's
any further report about you men I'll mention
the matter to the officer of the day. Where are
you going with that book, Overton?"</p>

<p>"Since the sight of myself disturbs the prisoners,"
Hal replied, "I am going to take my book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
outside."</p>

<p>"I'd rather you wouldn't," replied Corporal
Sykes crisply. "Members of the guard have a
right in here, and prisoners who don't like a
member of the guard had no business to become
prisoners."</p>

<small>PROMOTION FLIES IN THE AIR</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> FEW days later the court-martial was
convened at Fort Clowdry.</p>

<p>In the cases of the three "solitaries"
the evidence was speedily in.</p>

<p>With the evidence furnished by Hal, Noll,
Hyman and others, the accused delinquents were
found guilty.</p>

<p>At the trial there had come another surprise.
Evidence had just been forwarded from the recruiting
office where Dowley had enlisted. This
evidence showed that Frank Dowley was a highly
respected man in his own part of the country,
but he had left home and gone hundreds of
miles away for new employment.</p>

<p>The prisoner who stood before the court as
Dowley was Frederick Cramp in his own proper
name, and had served a term in jail for robbery.
Cramp had a generally bad reputation. Finding
himself closely pursued by the sheriff's officers
for a newly committed crime, Cramp had seized
upon the inspiration to enter the Army under
the assumed name of Dowley. In the ranks he
believed that none of the pursuing officers would
think of looking for him.</p>

<p>The references of the supposed Dowley had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
come back from the home town with such splendid
endorsement that the enlisting officer had
imagined that he had found a most satisfactory
recruit in Frederick Cramp.</p>

<p>It is likely that the deceit would never have
been discovered, had not Frank Dowley&mdash;the
real one&mdash;lately returned to his home town. He
had been astounded when his friends had questioned
him about Army life, and, on hearing
the news, had hastened to the nearest recruiting
office, from which this strange story had come
to be laid before the court-martial just in time
to punish the culprit.</p>

<p>"Dowley" was sentenced to be dishonorably
dismissed from the service, with forfeiture of
pay and allowances, to serve one year at a military
prison and then to be turned over to the
civil authorities for such further punishment as
might develop.</p>

<p>Corporal Minturn, too, was sentenced to be
dismissed from the service, and to serve one
year at a military prison.</p>

<p>Private Bill Hooper got off with simple dismissal.</p>

<p>Then the prisoners were sent back to the guard
house until the findings and sentences had been
passed upon and signed by the department commander.</p>

<p>A week later the papers were returned with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the endorsement of the brigadier general commanding
the department.</p>

<p>Dowley, Hooper and Minturn left under guard
the same day.</p>

<p>"They're all generals now," mimicked Private
Hyman.</p>

<p>"Generals?" queried Noll.</p>

<p>"Yes; general prisoners."</p>

<p>"Bill Hooper will be on the retired list when
he reaches Denver, anyway," smiled Hal.
"Having no stretch to serve, he's to be turned
loose when the guard reaches that city."</p>

<p>The morning after, as Colonel North sat in
his office at headquarters, an orderly entered
and handed him a telegram.</p>

<p>"Orderly!" called the colonel crisply two minutes
later.</p>

<p>A young soldier of the guard stepped in, saluting
and standing at attention.</p>

<p>"Orderly, my compliments to Captain Cortland,
and ask him to attend me here as soon as
possible."</p>

<p>Five minutes later B Company's commander
entered and saluted.</p>

<p>"Take a seat, Cortland," urged the older man.
"I have a telegram here that will interest you.
It's from the senior surgeon at department military
hospital. Corporal Hapgood, of your company,
who was sent there for treatment, died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
yesterday. A very bad case of typhoid had
developed."</p>

<p>"Then poor Hapgood won't be sent back here
for burial, sir?"</p>

<p>"No; the dispatch says that the corporal is
being buried there to-day."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for Hapgood," said Captain Cortland
solemnly, a slight break in his voice. "He
was a man, every inch of him, and a fine soldier
with big promise for the future. I have his
mother's address, and I will write her. But the
best kind of letter will seem a poor substitute
for a son in the case of that lonely old mother.
He was all she had."</p>

<p>"The mother will be able to draw a pension of
twelve dollars a month for the rest of her life,
then," replied the colonel. "That is something,
even if not as good as having a live son to comfort
her."</p>

<p>"Yes; the pension will be assured," mused
Captain Cortland.</p>

<p>"By the way, Cortland, you are now shy
on two corporals in your company."</p>

<p>"Yes, Colonel; I was about to speak of that
to you."</p>

<p>"Whom do you want appointed in their
places?"</p>

<p>The colonel of a regiment appoints all non-commissioned
officers in his regiment; he also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
"breaks," or reduces them to the ranks at his
pleasure, if any need comes up.</p>

<p>But, though the colonel has the appointive
power, he always consults with the commander
of a company about any new appointments of
non-coms. in that company.</p>

<p>"I have several good men who are entitled
to appointment," replied Captain Cortland
slowly.</p>

<p>"Then you haven't made up your mind?"</p>

<p>"I can, easily, sir, if you wish it."</p>

<p>"I am thinking, captain, only of the fact that,
if the appointments be not promptly made you
will run very short on corporals," replied the
colonel.</p>

<p>"There's Hyman, sir, and Conrad. Both are
bright, attentive soldiers. Then there are Overton
and Terry. They're quite new men, but
they've made records for themselves in the short
time they've been with us."</p>

<p>"Any others?" asked Colonel North, tapping
his knee with the pencil that he held in one
hand.</p>

<p>"A few others, sir, but none with quite as good
claims as the four men I've named."</p>

<p>"Whom do you favor most, Captain?"</p>

<p>"It's hard to say, sir. Hyman is nearly
through with his enlistment, and Conrad in the
middle of his third enlistment. Now, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
length of service it looks as though Conrad ought
to have one of the appointments."</p>

<p>"A man who is well along in his third enlistment,
and hasn't been made a non-com. in
all that time ought not to have much consideration
if there are other men with better natural
claims," replied Colonel North. "A man who is
thoroughly qualified to be a corporal ought to
get there in less than seven or eight years, don't
you think so?"</p>

<p>"That's true, sir," Captain Cortland nodded.</p>

<p>"Is Hyman as good a man as Overton or
Terry?" continued the regimental commander,
apparently much interested.</p>

<p>"He has had longer experience, but I think
Overton and Terry are both a shade above Hyman
in natural aptitude; in fact, the lads are
considerably above him."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see your drift, Colonel, and I agree with
you. I therefore urge, sir, that Overton and
Terry be appointed as corporals, and I will keep
Hyman in mind for the next chance that comes
up."</p>

<p>"You are satisfied, then, Captain, to make
Overton and Terry corporals?"</p>

<p>"More than satisfied, Colonel. One of these
days they'll be sergeants, at that. A company
commander, I take it, sir, can't start too early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
to fire the spark of ambition in the right
men."</p>

<p>"You and I are agreed on that, then, Cortland.
I am glad you have recommended Overton and
Terry as corporals. I will have their appointments
published in orders this afternoon."</p>

<p>No suspicion had Hal or Noll when they fell
in for parade that afternoon.</p>

<p>When Lieutenant Wright, battalion adjutant,
published the orders, he read off four routine
orders before he came to that creating Private
Hal Overton a corporal in B Company.</p>

<p>"Whew! It has come, but I didn't expect
anything like that," quivered Soldier Hal. "I
didn't think I could do it inside of a year."</p>

<p>"Lucky Hal," thought Private Terry. "He
has gotten ahead of me, but I'm glad just the
same. It has always been the rule for Hal to
beat me, anyway."</p>

<p>The next order made Noll Terry's hair stand
up. He had been made a corporal, too.</p>

<p>How the hearts of both danced when the regimental
band played the headquarter's battalion
from the parade ground.</p>

<p>"You two are the lucky soldier kids," cried
Private Hyman, coming up to the boys with outstretched
hands. "How did you manage it?"</p>

<p>"That's the point, Hyman," laughed Hal
happily; "we didn't manage it. It just happened."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the quartermaster's store closed both
soldier boys drew their corporal's chevrons, then
hunted up the company tailor to get him to sew
these prized badges of rank on their sleeves.</p>

<p>"I suppose, Sergeant, one or both of us will
be transferred from your squad room," said
Hal regretfully, when they encountered Hupner.</p>

<p>"I've heard nothing to that effect as yet, Corporal,"
replied the room sergeant.</p>

<p>"Corporal!" How wonderfully fine that simple
title sounded, though the title meant but one
step above that of plain private soldier.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for one thing, Corporal," laughed
Private Hyman, that night after supper.</p>

<p>"What's that?" Hal queried.</p>

<p>"I'm extremely sorry that your old chums,
Hooper and Dowley, tired of the Army too soon
to see your chevrons on your sleeves. Say, but
I think those chevrons are about the handsomest
I've ever seen," added Private Hyman, an undertone
of wistfulness in his voice.</p>

<p>The next day brought more good news. The
date was set on which headquarter's band and
the first battalion of the Thirty-fourth was to
leave for Denver, to take part in the summer
encampment of the Colorado National Guard.
Neither Corporal Overton nor Corporal Terry
was assigned to the guard detachment that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
to remain behind.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Greg Holmes, only a few months
out of West Point, drew a "blank" that made
his face look gloomy. Lieutenant Holmes was
the only officer in the battalion who was to remain
behind. He was to have command of the
guard that was to take care of the post in the
absence of the troops.</p>

<small>THE PRICE OF BEING A MAN</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE occasion was the encampment of the
Colorado National Guard, and the scene
was a few miles outside of Denver.</p>

<p>Here was some of the real glory of the soldier's
life!</p>

<p>At the head of the line rode two troops of
cavalry belonging to the regular Army.</p>

<p>Immediately behind these yellow-legs an awe-inspiring
drum-major strode along, his glittering,
ball-tipped staff going through many smart
movements. Right behind him came the Thirty-fourth
U. S. Infantry Band, crashing out a soul-stirring
march.</p>

<p>At the heels of the band rode Colonel North,
Major Silsbee and staff, a splendid, soldierly
looking lot in saddle.</p>

<p>Then the head of A Company, Captain Ruggles
commanding. B Company next, and to B
Company fell the honor of being color company
and escorting the Flag. C and D behind&mdash;the
whole khaki-clad battalion moving at easy swing,
and yet in the straight, precise lines that only
regulars know how to display, however close
near-soldiers may imagine they come in excellence.
Over all, in brisk cadence, and in exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
time to the spirited music ahead, sounded the
steady whump! whump! whump! of the exactly
gaited feet of regulars on the march.</p>

<p>No wonder the crowd that lined the sides
of the road cheered! No wonder that girls
waved handkerchiefs! Here and there men,
youths and boys who knew enough lifted their
hats as the colors passed.</p>

<p>It is strange that not all American males, of
all ages, know that the hat is to be raised from
the head and lowered to place over the heart as
the national colors are borne by.</p>

<p>Yet all of those of the male spectators who
did not know enough to uncover on the approach
of the colors still felt the glory of the scene.
Love of the military is common to all true-beating
hearts. The country dies in which this love
of the military vanishes.</p>

<p>Behind the infantry lumbered the guns and
caissons of two batteries of field artillery, drivers
alert and gunners sitting up very straight, yet
appearing wholly at ease.</p>

<p>It takes the man of military experience to be
both erect and at ease at the same time. Some
civilians come very close in this achievement,
but theirs is the imitation grace of personal carriage.</p>

<p>At the extreme left of the line marched a
platoon of engineer troops and a detachment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
men from the signal corps.</p>

<p>The regulars were now in the last half mile
of the march down a beautifully shaded road
that led to the broad fields on which the encampment
was pitched this year.</p>

<p>Hundreds of boys were following the parade
as a matter of course. Where is the live boy
whose heart is dead to the soldiers?</p>

<p>As the Thirty-fourth's band played out the
final notes of the march, the order for route
step marching ran down the line.</p>

<p>Just then, from a parallel road less than a
quarter of a mile away, another band blared
forth in a quickstep. The crowd was quick to
turn and look.</p>

<p>Through the intervals between trees and
bushes could be seen another line of military.
An entire brigade of the National Guard was
over on that road, also headed for the encampment
field.</p>

<p>"Hey, Tommie!" called one boy to another.
"Cut across with me. There's about ten miles
of sogers over there!"</p>

<p>"Chase yourself, if you wanter go," yelled
back Tommie. "They're militia. Me for here,
with the real-thing sogers, just back from the
wars!"</p>

<p>There was a laugh from many in the crowd,
while the smaller boys whooped. It was hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
even for the erect regulars in ranks to repress
their grins when they received that tribute from
a discerning small boy.</p>

<p>But the small American boy, even if ignorant
of everything else in the soldier's manuals, can
usually be depended upon to know the difference
between regulars and militiamen. To the small
boy's mind the difference is as great as that
between the circus and the country fair.</p>

<p>Uncle Sam's musicians struck up again, just
as the column entered the encampment field.</p>

<p>Wagon trains had gone on ahead.</p>

<p>Regulars and national guardsmen broke ranks
at nearly the same moment.</p>

<p>Then followed an exhibition that some of the
spectators never forgot.</p>

<p>In about a half an hour the regular troops had
their tents up, in straight, precise company
streets, and all their belongings moved in. Nor
were these the "dog-tents" of field duty. As
the encampment was to last for a week, the
regulars slept at night in full-sized Army tents,
with several men in each tent.</p>

<p>At the end of two hours the national guardsmen
were still perspiring over their tasks of
pitching camp.</p>

<p>The regulars, cool and wholly at ease, were
going about other camp duties.</p>

<p>"Look at the amateurs over yonder," grinned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Corporal Noll Terry, calling his chum's attention
to the brigade of national guardsmen.</p>

<p>"Poor fellows, it's a good deal like work for
them," remarked Hal. "They're not drilled in
this thing all the time."</p>

<p>"They go about it like so many clowns,"
laughed Noll.</p>

<p>"Now, I wouldn't say that," urged Corporal
Hal. "Remember, the national guardsmen do
other things for a living, and do this work for
love of state and country."</p>

<p>"But why do they need to be such boobs about
pitching a camp?" demanded Noll.</p>

<p>"Because it isn't their accustomed business,"
Hal retorted.</p>

<p>"Bosh! The tin soldiers make me tired,"
laughed Corporal Noll.</p>

<p>"Then you want to change your attitude,"
warned Hal, "for you've got the wrong view,
old fellow. There probably isn't a man over
in that militia brigade who wouldn't make a
smart enough regular if he enlisted."</p>

<p>"Now, I don't know about that," argued
Corporal Noll seriously.</p>

<p>"I can remember the time, not very long ago,
Noll, when you and I were greener than any
militiaman over yonder."</p>

<p>"We were green," admitted Corporal Terry,
"but not green in the same way that those state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
troops are. Some how, regulars and militiamen
are quite a different proposition from the very
first day."</p>

<p>"True," agreed Corporal Hal. "But what
makes the difference?"</p>

<p>"Well, what does?"</p>

<p>"The difference in officers, and in the methods
that can be used. Militia officers have to
make soldiering the study of their leisure hours,
just as the guardsmen in the ranks do. Our
regular officers are first given a hard training,
and then make a life study of soldiering. Keep
those guardsmen in camp for three months, and
put regular officers over them all the time, and
I tell you, Noll, they'd make most of us regulars
look hard to our laurels."</p>

<p>"I don't know," muttered Corporal Terry
dubiously.</p>

<p>"Then you want to think it over," retorted
Hal. "Just remember that regulars and militiamen
are both enlisted from the people at large.
Put any militia regiment in the country through
a regulation three-years' enlistment in the Army
and under regular officers, and that militia regiment
would then be the equal of any regular
regiment in the line. Noll, the whole difference
lies in officers, opportunity and training. Don't
ever look down on national guardsmen unless
you want to prove yourself less of a soldier than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
I think you are."</p>

<p>"Corporal Terry!" summoned Sergeant
Gray, and Noll hurried off to some new duty, but
he was thinking. Corporal Hal had shown him
how to look at the national guardsmen from another
point of view.</p>

<p>The day was one of arduous duties, but with
nightfall came a period of rest. More, some of
the regulars in each company, troop or battery
were granted town leave. There was a trolley
line near at hand that carried many a pleasure-loving
regular into town.</p>

<p>Corporals Overton and Terry went by themselves.</p>

<p>"As we have never seen Denver, I guess it
will be about enough for us to look around and
see what we can of the town, won't it?" proposed
Hal.</p>

<p>"Yes; if we keep to the main streets. I feel
as though I may want to squander a bit of my
pay on ice cream and such frothy trifles," returned
Noll.</p>

<p>"We won't spend it, anyway, on anything that
will make us forget the limits of our leave and
turn delinquents," returned Hal.</p>

<p>"Small danger of that," retorted Corporal
Terry. "That game doesn't go with the making
of good soldiers."</p>

<p>"I don't believe Captain Cortland will have
any delinquents to deal with this time," predicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Hal. "He doesn't intend to have the
Mason City business done over again."</p>

<p>Denver proved full of delights to these soldier
boys, who had really seen very little of the world.</p>

<p>But, being under orders to return to camp not
later than midnight, the time came when they
must think of getting back.</p>

<p>"I wonder what's the quickest way to the trolley
line?" pondered Noll.</p>

<p>"We'll ask our way," Hal answered.</p>

<p>They had no trouble in getting clear directions
from a passing citizen. The shortest way
led down through a narrow street that appeared
to belong to a rough part of the city.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't care to live on this street," smiled
Noll.</p>

<p>"Hardly," agreed Hal. "Yet I guess it won't
hurt us any just to walk through."</p>

<p>Ere the soldier boys had gone more than two
blocks their attention was attracted by sounds
of a commotion in a crowd just ahead.</p>

<p>A crowd had started to collect, and was every
moment increasing in size.</p>

<p>"Wonder what's up?" murmured Noll Terry,
as the soldier boys quickened their pace.</p>

<p>"Some earthquake in the under world, I suppose,"
returned Hal.</p>

<p>Just then the scream of a woman's voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
reached them.</p>

<p>"Shame! shame!" cried half a dozen male
voices in protest.</p>

<p>Then the same voice sounded, in sobs this
time.</p>

<p>Hal Overton had broken into a run, and Noll
was almost at his side. The soldier boys pushed
their way into the crowd.</p>

<p>A brutish, square-jawed young fellow of
twenty-one or twenty-two, dressed loudly, and
with an ill-smelling cigar between his teeth at
one side of his mouth, held a sobbing girl by
the wrist.</p>

<p>"Cut out the boo-hoo story, Lizzie, and come
along with me to the dance," he ordered gruffly.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go," faltered the terrified
girl. "You know well enough, Bill, that my
mother don't want me going to dances with
you."</p>

<p>"What's your old woman got against me?"
demanded the young brute.</p>

<p>"You know well enough, Bill, that mother
don't like you, and that she'd sooner see me
dead than running around with you."</p>

<p>"She won't have her wish to-night, then, Liz.
You're going to waltz with me. You know that
wot I say goes, and it's the hop for yours to-night."</p>

<p>"Shame!" cried some one back in the crowd.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
"Let the girl go home."</p>

<p>"Mind your own biz," growled back the bully,
"or I'll step over there and make some changes
in yer style of face."</p>

<p>Evidently Bill was known as an ugly customer.
Close to him, on the other side from the girl,
stood another man, somewhat older and exhibiting
the promise of even more brute strength.
Plainly he stood by to back Bill up against interference
that the crowd might want to attempt.
The pair of bullies were such as a city
crowd usually doesn't care to risk meddling
with.</p>

<p>"Wipe off the boo-hoo, Lizzie, and come
along," ordered the fellow who held the girl's
wrist. "No use of making a fuss. You're
headed for the waltz with me."</p>

<p>"Shame!" some one in the crowd had courage
enough to utter again, as Bill, still holding the
girl's wrist, started to force her along the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"What do you more decent people expect to
do by just talking?" Corporal Hal Overton demanded
angrily.</p>

<p>"Hullo, brass-button boy!" called Bill cheerily,
turning and leering at the youthful-looking
corporal. "When did you blow out of the
sewer?"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>"If that young lady wishes to go home, let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
her do so," ordered Hal sternly.</p>

<p>"So?" queried Bill mockingly. "But maybe
that won't suit me."</p>

<p>"Then let go of the young lady's wrist, for
you'll need both hands up in front of you,"
warned Hal, springing forward, his hot blood
flushing his face with righteous anger.</p>

<p>"Get out, ye tin-soldier militiaman!"</p>

<p>"If it makes any difference," retorted Hal,
"we happen to be regulars."</p>

<p>"No difference at all," the young brute leered.
"I eat both kinds!"</p>

<p>"Let go that young lady's wrist!"</p>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<p>Bill did so, and the girl shrank back through
the pressing crowd. But Bill aimed a crushing
blow at Corporal Hal Overton.</p>

<p>Hal wasn't just on the spot to receive it. But
the next instant he and Bill were exchanging
hard blows at a rate that made the crowd yell
with delight.</p>

<p>"Go it, Bill! Go it, buttons!"</p>

<p>Bill's tough friend reached out to hit Hal from
the side. Corporal Noll jumped in, throwing
up the fellow's arm. There were two real
fights on now.</p>

<p>How it would have ended it would be impossible
to say. Strong, daring and skilled though
they were, the soldier boys might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
beaten by superior strength.</p>

<p>But a heavy, blue-coated figure darted in, scattering
the combatants. Then a Denver policeman
gripped both Hal and Noll by the collar.</p>

<p>"Stop it! Stop, I tell ye!" ordered the policeman
gruffly.</p>

<p>"Ye've got good game there, Johnson," called
out the fellow Bill. "They're a nasty pair of
brass buttons. They insulted my girl, and then
pitched into me and my friend."</p>

<p>"I'll run these soldier-loafers in, Bill," agreed
the policeman. "We've got too many of these
soldier-loafers in the country. It's time for
some of 'em to learn something."</p>

<p>For Bill and his friend were a pair of amateur
thugs who were most useful to the ward's ruling
political machine. Bill and his friend were often
extremely useful in cleaning out hostile primaries,
and in other dirty work incidental to
city politics.</p>

<p>"Officer!" protested Corporal Hal.</p>

<p>"Shut up, ye loafer!" ordered the policeman.</p>

<p>"But this is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will ye shut up, now?"</p>

<p>The policeman gave the soldier boy a vigorous
shaking.</p>

<p>"The soldiers were in the right of it, Johnson,"
protested a voice in the crowd.</p>

<p>"Now, can yer gab, or I'll run you in, too,"
warned Johnson hoarsely. At that dread warning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
opposition died out in the weak-kneed crowd.</p>

<p>"Now, come along, ye young loafers in brass
buttons," commanded the policeman. "Bill,
you and your friend be in court in the morning."</p>

<p>"Sure we will," chuckled Bill.</p>

<p>"Officer, will you let me explain?" insisted
Hal, as the two young corporals started down
the street on either side of the policeman, who
kept a rough grip on the arm of either.</p>

<p>"Pickle it, and tell it all to the judge in the
morning," retorted the policeman gruffly.</p>

<p>Some of the crowd&mdash;Bill's friends, evidently&mdash;followed,
hooting and abusing all soldiers in
general.</p>

<p>Four blocks away Hal and Noll were lined
up before the officer in charge at a station house.</p>

<p>"Assaulting Bill Dabner and his friend and
insulting Bill's girl," announced Policeman
Johnson gruffly.</p>

<p>"I hope now, sir, we can have a chance to
explain," protested Hal, looking squarely at
the officer behind the desk.</p>

<p>"Did you see all this business, Johnson?"
asked the officer at the desk.</p>

<p>"Yes," lied the policeman glibly. "I caught
'em at it."</p>

<p>"You men can save your explanations for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
the judge in the morning," wound up the officer
at the desk. "Cell number twelve, Johnson."</p>

<p>Down below the cell door clanged on two
white-faced, angry young soldier boys. It was a
serious thing, they knew, for ambitious soldiers
to have a clash with the civil authorities.</p>

<p>"We'll lose our corporal's chevrons through
this," Noll predicted.</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Corporal Hal Overton, his
eyes flashing. "But I can't help it if we do.
It's worth that price to be a man!"</p>

<small>TWO YOUNG CORPORALS SEND OUT THE "C. Q. D."</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN the two young corporals had had
time to cool down somewhat, Hal
made a racket on his cell door until
a house policeman came to see what was wanted.</p>

<p>"Will you bring me paper and an envelope?"
Hal asked.</p>

<p>"Want to make your will, I suppose," jeered
the policeman.</p>

<p>"No; I intend to write a note to my company
commander."</p>

<p>"Is he out at camp?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Who do you think is going to take the note
out there?"</p>

<p>"Call a messenger boy, and I will pay him
for going out there," Corporal Hal replied.</p>

<p>"I don't believe the lieutenant at the desk
will do it," returned the policeman.</p>

<p>"See here," Hal went on, warming up perceptibly,
"we are members of the United States
forces, under detention by the civil authorities.
Now, the civil authorities have full right to arrest
United States soldiers on proper charges.
We'll let the question pass of whether we've
been properly arrested. But, as members of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the United States Army, we have a right to
communicate with our commanding officer. If
this isn't done, the governor of Colorado is quite
likely to hear from Washington. Now, we demand
paper and envelope, and also that a messenger
boy be called to take our letter."</p>

<p>"I don't know what the lieutenant will
say&mdash;&mdash;" began the house policeman dubiously.</p>

<p>"Of course you don't," Hal broke in. "So
go and find out what he says, won't you? And
you might explain to him my version of what
is likely to happen if he fails to give us a chance
to communicate promptly with Captain Cortland."</p>

<p>Twenty minutes passed.</p>

<p>"They're just laughing at us," muttered Noll.</p>

<p>"Then in the morning they may find where
the laugh really belongs," Hal retorted.</p>

<p>"Hush! Here comes some one."</p>

<p>It was the house policeman, returning with
stationery and a messenger boy.</p>

<p>Taking a pencil from one of his pockets, Hal
wrote at some length, though he tried to make
his letter as brief as possible.</p>

<p>"Got any matches, boy?" Hal asked of the
waiting messenger.</p>

<p>The boy passed a small box in through the
grating of the door.</p>

<p>"Here, stop that!" warned the policeman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
though he reached forward too late to stop the
passing of the matches.</p>

<p>"You shall have them back in a moment,"
Hal promised the boy.</p>

<p>Drawing a piece of sealing wax from another
pocket, Hal lighted a match, dropping the hot
wax over the flap of the envelope.</p>

<p>"Here, you can't do that," warned the house
policeman, who, however, could get the cell door
key only by going upstairs to the desk.</p>

<p>"But I've already done it," smiled Hal.</p>

<p>Noll handed his chum a signet ring, which
Hal pressed into the wax.</p>

<p>"That won't go," muttered the policeman.
"The lieutenant won't have it. He has to see
all letters that go out of this station."</p>

<p>"Then let your lieutenant break the seal, or
interfere in any way with the prompt delivery
of an official communication between a member
of the United States Army and his commanding
officer, and see what will happen to your lieutenant
upstairs. If the lieutenant is a friend
of yours you might call that little point to his
attention," Hal retorted, with a cool smile, as
he passed the envelope to the messenger.</p>

<p>"How much will it be to deliver that letter
promptly out at the camp?" Corporal Overton
inquired.</p>

<p>The messenger boy named the sum, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Overton added carfare and a little "tip."</p>

<p>"As quickly as you can, please, boy. And
report to your manager in case the lieutenant,
or any other policeman attempts to hinder or
bother you on this work. We shall want your
report as evidence if you are interfered with."</p>

<p>"Say, that kid corporal downstairs knows all
his rights," declared the house policeman admiringly
to the lieutenant, after the messenger
had departed unmolested.</p>

<p>"He'll forget a large part of what he knows,
after he's been before the judge in the morning,"
replied the lieutenant, lighting a cigar.
"Soldiers, as well as citizens, can be punished,
and Johnson has a clear case against that pair
of soldier kids."</p>

<p>For the next two hours Hal and Noll took
turns pacing back and forth within the narrow
confines of the cell in which they had been thrust.</p>

<p>"I guess we're not going to hear anything
to-night," muttered Hal disappointedly at last.
"Noll, we may as well get some of the sleep
that's coming to us."</p>

<p>Young soldiers accustomed to sleeping on the
ground did not find it extremely hard to get to
sleep on the hard wooden benches. More than
that, they contrived to get a pretty fair rest
before they were awakened in the morning by
a station-house trusty who thrust two chunks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
bread and two tin cups of coffee into the cell.</p>

<p>"Get that down and be ready to go to court,"
called the trusty as he passed along.</p>

<p>Breakfast eaten, the two young corporals had
a lot more time on their hands before a squad of
policemen came downstairs and began to busy
themselves with marshaling the prisoners and
driving them toward a basement door.</p>

<p>Here, mingled with the scum of the city, in
the persons of other prisoners, two unoffending
young soldiers of the United States Army were
forced to enter the dark interior of a covered
wagon. A steel door was slammed into place
and locked and the ride began.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they were let out, superintended
by a guard of other policemen, and driven
into another basement. Here, in a dark, dingy,
foul-smelling room, this batch of prisoners was
herded with those from other police stations.</p>

<p>A lot of time passed. Occasionally court policemen
came into the room, selected more prisoners
and drove them out toward a stairway.</p>

<p>At last it came the turn of Corporals Hal
and Noll. They were taken from the room, up
an iron staircase, and then pushed into the pen
of a police court.</p>

<p>"Henry Overton and Oliver Terry!" called
a clerk.</p>

<p>"There's yer cue," announced a gruff court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
policeman, pointing to the two young soldiers.
He conducted them to the front of the pen where
they stood facing a police magistrate.</p>

<p>The clerk announced the charge against them,
then ordered wearily:</p>

<p>"Prisoners, hold up your right hands. You
do solemnly swear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The two young corporals had been duly sworn
to tell the truth.</p>

<p>"Where's the arresting officer?" demanded
Judge Guffey.</p>

<p>Policeman Johnson came forward, held up his
hand and was sworn.</p>

<p>Then the policeman started to tell the story
of what he claimed to have seen. According
to this evidence, Noll and Hal had first insulted
a young woman with whom Bill Dabner was
walking at the time. Bill had naturally resented
the insults, and then the soldiers had violently
assaulted Bill and his male friend, while the girl
broke through the gathering crowd and fled for
home.</p>

<p>Then Bill came forward, in his best, loudest
clothes, and with his hair much greased. Bill's
story, under oath, put a few flourishes to Policeman
Johnson's plainer tale. Bill's friend
was also there and backed up all that the policeman
and Dabner had said.</p>

<p>"We have plenty of other witnesses, your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
honor, if you desire to examine more," interposed
the policeman.</p>

<p>"Where's the young woman herself?" queried
Judge Guffey.</p>

<p>"Home in bed, ill from the shock, your
honor," Bill asserted gravely.</p>

<p>"Prisoners at the bar, have you anything to
say?" queried Judge Guffey. "Overton?"</p>

<p>"I've a lot to say, your honor."</p>

<p>In tones ringing with indignation, Corporal
Hal Overton, United States Army, gave his version
of the affair. Bill Dabner listened with a
broad, impudent grin, as Hal told the true story
of the encounter of the night before.</p>

<p>Then Noll spoke in his own behalf.</p>

<p>"I saw the assault myself, your honor, and
have other witnesses here for our side if you
wish to hear them," said Policeman Johnson.</p>

<p>"This testimony is very much confused," commented
Judge Guffey at last. "But the evidence
of the police officer is evidently worth that
of all the other witnesses combined, for the policeman
has no personal prejudices in the matter.
Prisoners at the bar, you appear to have
forgotten that you were sworn into the Army
and enrolled among the defenders and protectors
of the country. It is no light thing to insult
a young woman, even if she does happen
to belong to the poorer classes of society. Prisoners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
such conduct as yours, under any circumstances,
is a disgrace to the splendid uniform
that you wear. Soldier hoodlumism shall find
no more sanction in this court than any other
kind of rowdyism. I sentence you each, therefore&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Judge Guffey's voice paused for a moment,
as though the magistrate were thinking deeply.</p>

<p>Then he added:</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash; to thirty days in the workhouse!"</p>

<small>THE WIND CHANGES ITS COURSE AND BLOWS</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was a dazing, fearful blow to two lads who
had acted in accordance with their highest
ideals of right.</p>

<p>"Step down there," ordered the court officer,
giving the young corporals a light shove.</p>

<p>"You've got yours."</p>

<p>Policeman Johnson, Bill Dabner and the latter's
crony turned to leave, as though satisfied
that they had done their duty.</p>

<p>At the back of the courtroom there was a
slight commotion. Some one there was endeavoring
to push his way through the throng.</p>

<p>"Your honor, one moment!" called a deep,
manly voice. "Before the case of the two soldiers
is disposed of I wish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was some one in uniform at the back of
the court room. More Judge Guffey could not
ascertain at that moment.</p>

<p>"Who spoke then?" demanded the magistrate.</p>

<p>"My name is Cortland, your honor. I am
captain of the company to which the two corporals
belong."</p>

<p>At the first sound of that voice Hal and Noll
had turned back to the front of the pen.</p>

<p>"Get down below, you!" scowled the court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
officer.</p>

<p>"Will you be good enough to hold your tongue,
my man?" asked Corporal Hal in a quiet voice,
though his eyes flashed. "That's our captain
speaking, and his is the voice we follow."</p>

<p>"Let the prisoners wait," directed Judge Guffey,
sending the court officer an annoyed glance.
"Make way for Captain Cortland to come forward."</p>

<p>Policeman Johnson and Bill and his friend
were trying to get out of the court room, but
the magistrate called to them to come back.</p>

<p>"Captain," continued the magistrate, "I regret
to say that the evidence proved that your
two men most wantonly insulted a young woman
on the streets last night, and then attacked her
escort and a friend."</p>

<p>Captain Cortland, as he came to a halt below
the bench in that crowded court room, presented
a fine appearance that was in distinct contrast
with his surroundings.</p>

<p>"With due respect for the court, your honor.
I don't believe that any such disgraceful conduct
was engaged in by my young men."</p>

<p>"But even the policeman's testimony bears
out that of the real complainants, Captain," replied
Judge Guffey courteously.</p>

<p>"Your honor, I don't know your policeman,
but I do know my two young men, Corporals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
Overton and Terry. I am as positive as I can
be of anything that neither young soldier is of
the kind to allow himself to get into any kind
of disgraceful affair. There are no men in my
company for whom I entertain deeper respect
than I do for Corporals Overton and Terry.
Your honor, may I ask that this case be reopened?"</p>

<p>"I would gladly extend you that courtesy,
Captain Cortland, but the evidence has all been
heard. As I understand it, Captain, you can
testify only to the previous good character of
the prisoners. You were not a witness of last
night's occurrence?"</p>

<p>"I was not, your honor, but I know my two
young men so well that I feel certain, sir, that
you are unwittingly aiding in a miscarriage of
justice. Will the court be good enough to outline
the nature of the evidence?"</p>

<p>Briefly Judge Guffey outlined the story of the
prosecution, and also the opposed story told by
Corporals Overton and Terry.</p>

<p>"Your honor may think me unduly trustful,"
smiled Captain Cortland, "but I would believe
the story of my men over the testimony of a
hundred men such as these complainants seem
to be."</p>

<p>Captain Cortland took a side look at Bill and
his friend, who unaccountably shivered under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
that scrutiny.</p>

<p>"Has the young woman herself appeared in
court, your honor?" resumed B Company's captain.
"Has she testified?"</p>

<p>"I understand," replied Judge Guffey, "that
the young woman is ill in bed as a result of
the shock of last night's occurrence."</p>

<p>"Then, your honor," asked Captain Cortland,
"may I ask a continuance of this case until the
testimony of the young woman herself may have
been heard, and until I can look up other evidence?
And will you accept my personal bail
for Corporals Overton and Terry in the meantime?"</p>

<p>"I want to show you every courtesy possible,
Captain," began Judge Guffey.</p>

<p>"And I ask nothing, your honor, except that
my men have every opportunity for impartial
justice."</p>

<p>While this conversation had been going on
an extremely mild-mannered man in rather
dingy black, had been quietly working his way
forward. He had just succeeded in passing a
card to the clerk of the court and in adding a
few whispered words.</p>

<p>"Your honor," interposed the clerk, "here is
another witness who offers, and wishes to be
heard. He can bring us tidings of the young
woman who has been mentioned in connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
with this case."</p>

<p>Judge Guffey took the card, reading from it:</p>

<p>"Dr. Alexander McKenzie."</p>

<p>"That is my name, sir," replied the quiet man.</p>

<p>"What do you know of this case, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"Not much, sir, but it may be important,"
replied the physician. "I was called in this
morning by the mother of one Lizzie McAndrew,
the girl mentioned in this affair. Miss McAndrew
is quite ill this morning, as the result of a
nervous shock, but her mind is clear enough.
She begged me particularly to come to court to
see that two brave and gallant young soldiers
did not come to harm through befriending her."</p>

<p>Captain Cortland uttered a low-voiced, triumphant
exclamation.</p>

<p>At a motion from the clerk Dr. McKenzie
started around toward the pen to be sworn.</p>

<p>Policeman Johnson, his face violently red,
whispered a few words in the ear of the physician
as the latter passed.</p>

<p>"Now, don't bother me with your talk," retorted
the physician in a rather loud voice, and
Johnson drew back.</p>

<p>"What did that policeman say to you?" demanded
the magistrate as soon as the medical
man had been sworn.</p>

<p>"He told me to look out what I said, or I'd
get myself in big trouble down in the district,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
replied Dr. McKenzie promptly.</p>

<p>"I never&mdash;&mdash;" began Johnson, his face paling.</p>

<p>"Put that policeman under arrest!" thundered
the magistrate.</p>

<p>A court officer moved over and stood beside
the now much-disturbed Johnson.</p>

<p>Dr. McKenzie testified to the serious condition
in which he had found Lizzie McAndrew this
morning. He was not permitted to repeat any
of the young woman's statements in her own
words, but was allowed to state the gist of what
Miss McAndrew had said.</p>

<p>"May I interrupt the court long enough to
ask if there is not now enough evidence to warrant
postponing this hearing for a few days?"
inquired Captain Cortland.</p>

<p>"I won't do it," replied Judge Guffey bluntly.
"Plainly enough this has been one of the court's
foolish mornings. I am now convinced that the
testimony on which I had sentenced these two
young soldiers was false evidence. Corporals
Overton and Terry are discharged from custody."</p>

<p>Hal and Noll were about to step from the pen
to join their captain when the magistrate interrupted:</p>

<p>"To you young military gentlemen I wish to
offer the court's apology. I apologize, also, in
the name of the State of Colorado and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
city of Denver. There is no calling more honorable
than that of the soldier, who offers his
comfort, his life and his blood for his country
at need. The soldier who forgets the high nature
of his calling and descends to rowdyism cannot
be too severely punished, but the soldier who
lives up to the high traditions of his calling cannot
be too well commended. Policeman Johnson,
step forward. Bear in mind that you are
still under oath. In what work or business are
Dabner and his friend engaged?"</p>

<p>"Why, your honor, I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have they any regular calling that you ever
heard of?"</p>

<p>"Your honor, I don't know," stammered the
policeman.</p>

<p>"Isn't it true that this precious pair seldom
work?" pressed the magistrate.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm afraid, your honor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Policeman Johnson, go to the complaint
clerk and swear to two short complaints charging
Dabner and his estimable friend with
vagrancy."</p>

<p>Johnson changed color swiftly three or four
times, but he went in a daze to carry out his
instructions.</p>

<p>As for Bill Dabner and his friend, they looked
as though they were seeing ghosts. They did
not attempt to speak until they were ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
to step into the pen and be sworn.</p>

<p>Then Policeman Johnson was called to the
stand. Reluctantly he testified that the new
prisoners were well known to be loafers, making
a living mainly by their wits.</p>

<p>Dabner and his friend were then asked to
testify in their own behalf, but they were too
badly overwhelmed to be able to say much.</p>

<p>"Prisoners," said Judge Guffey, gazing at
them in sheer disgust, "it would give me great
pleasure to bind you over for the grand jury
on charges of perjury committed this morning.
But I feel disinclined to take any action that may
drag these young soldiers away from their own
duties. Therefore, on the charge of vagrancy,
I sentence you each to two years in the workhouse.
Take those prisoners below at once."</p>

<p>Bill and his crony seemed barely able to walk
when they were forced below.</p>

<p>"Policeman Johnson, come forward! Do you
desire to offer any denial of the evidence concerning
the charge that Dr. McKenzie made
against you a few minutes ago!"</p>

<p>Johnson opened his mouth to speak, but under
the stern gaze of the police magistrate he found
it impossible to persist in his denial.</p>

<p>"Johnson, for attempting to intimidate a witness
in this court I sentence you to thirty days'
confinement at the workhouse. I shall also see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
to it that a full account of this matter reaches
the chief of police. That is all."</p>

<p>Captain Cortland thanked the court heartily.
Then, with his young soldier boys following, he
made his way from the court room. Dr. McKenzie
was at their heels when they reached
open air, and a pleasant chat of a few moments
followed.</p>

<p>"Men, I would have come to you much sooner
than I did," explained Captain Cortland, "but
an accident happened that couldn't be helped.
Through some stupidity your messenger left
your note over among the militiamen, and it did
not reach me until this morning. Then I came
as fast as I could travel."</p>

<p>The heartiest thanks of all three soldiers were
extended to Dr. McKenzie, after which the Army
party started back to camp.</p>

<p>Hal's adventures for the day, however, were
by no means yet ended.</p>

<p>As the three entered the regulars' infantry
camp, Captain Cortland caught sight of a horse
being held before his tent by one of his infantry
privates.</p>

<p>"I want to talk with you two a moment," remarked
B Company's commander, "but I see
that I have a visitor from the cavalry. Wait
outside until I summon you."</p>

<p>The horse, a beautiful animal, very plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
belonged to the cavalry, for the saddle blanket
and trappings were trimmed with yellow, which
is the cavalry color.</p>

<p>"Had much work this morning, Claxton?"
Hal asked of the private soldier who was holding
the horse's bridle.</p>

<p>"We've been going some, Corporal," replied
Claxton, with a smile. "And it was hot in the
sun to-day, too."</p>

<p>"Even at that," observed Corporal Hal
grimly, "I guess you had it easier here than
we did."</p>

<p>"You've been in some trouble, Corporal?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but now it's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Corporal Hal Overton never finished that sentence.
At that instant all three became aware
of a great clatter up the field.</p>

<p>A pair of horses attached to a light victoria
came racing down the field, passing close to
the head of the infantry camp.</p>

<p>There was no driver on the seat; the reins
were trailing at the heels of the runaways.</p>

<p>Nor did it take more than a glance to show
that both of the runaways were now frightened
past all hope of stopping them by any simple expedient.</p>

<p>Less than a quarter of a mile down the field
two regular and two militia field batteries were
drawn up in a long line, squarely in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
path of the flying horses.</p>

<p>Worse still, the horses belonging to the batteries
had been detached and sent to the rear.
There were some four hundred artillerymen in
all near the guns, but not one of them mounted
in this period of instruction.</p>

<p>The horses seemed bound to dash in among
the closely aligned field guns, wrecking the victoria
and probably killing the woman and girl
who now stood up in the vehicle screaming with
terror, but seemingly too frightened to jump.</p>

<p>This Corporal Hal saw in his one swift glance,
as the outfit went by like a whirlwind.</p>

<p>What he didn't see the soldier boy didn't even
stop to guess.</p>

<p>"Let go, Claxton!" he shouted, snatching the
bridle from the orderly's hand.</p>

<p>All in a twinkling Hal was up in saddle and
urging the magnificent cavalry animal forward.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>CORES of brave, quick-witted men in uniform
were leaping forward to use their
sweeping arms to divert the runaways.
But Corporal Hal's swift glance forward as
he bent over the neck of the cavalry horse and
urged it forward showed that these soldiers
could not possibly save the woman and girl in
the victoria.</p>

<p>To whichever side the horses might be forced
into dodging, the wild, snorting animals would
still run over blocking soldiers and bring up in
a confused tangle of wreckage among the guns.</p>

<p>"On&mdash;on with you!" roared Corporal Hal,
beating the horse's flank with one hand and
cudgeling with his heels.</p>

<p>That cavalry mount was a magnificent beast.
Corporal Overton was quickly up alongside the
victoria. Then he gained on the horses.</p>

<p>"Now, in close, you good old brute!" glowed
Overton, though his lips were bloodless as he
took the chance and threw the bridle over.</p>

<p>Bending sideways from the saddle, Corporal
Hal reached the bridle of the nigh horse.</p>

<p>Now he hung on grimly to the bridle of the
runaway, at the same time using his other arm to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
bring the splendidly trained cavalry horse back
on its haunches.</p>

<p>That nigh runaway was checked, somewhat,
but the pull threatened to drag Corporal Hal's
left arm out of its socket.</p>

<p>Something had to give way!</p>

<p>Then, with a suppressed yell, Overton felt himself
being torn from saddle.</p>

<p>He held on. The runaways tried to forge
ahead at renewed speed, but the determined
doughboy soldier, holding still to the bridle of
one of the animals, put a big check on the speed
of the runaways.</p>

<p>A few yards further they dashed, then slowed.
Now a score of artillerymen, regular and militia,
sprang in and seized the animals just as Corporal
Hal Overton, his uniform torn and dust-grimed,
and he himself bleeding, fell in the
dust.</p>

<p>But the runaways were stopped, and other soldiers
assisted the woman and her fourteen-year-old
daughter in safety to the ground.</p>

<p>Back of them all the fine cavalry horse stood
trembling and curious. This cavalry horse,
struck by the wheels of the victoria, now showed
blood spots along his glistening, lathered flanks.</p>

<p>"Get up, messmate," called one of the regular
artillerymen, bending over Overton. "You did
the whole trick like an Army man, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
ladies want to thank you."</p>

<p>He helped Hal to his feet. The soldier boy
trembled slightly and almost unconsciously put
a hand to his head.</p>

<p>"Your hat, mate? We'll help you find that."</p>

<p>But Hal's hand had gone to a cut on his
head from which blood was oozing, for just as
he went down one of the horses had struck him
a glancing kick there.</p>

<p>It was Corporal Noll Terry, who sprinting
desperately along the field, espied his chum's
campaign hat and picked it up with hardly a
slackening of his speed.</p>

<p>But Noll did run more slowly when he saw
Overton again standing on his feet. Now Noll
gently approached the cavalry horse, whose
bridle reins dangled.</p>

<p>"Easy now, boy," urged Noll as he approached
and reached for the lines.</p>

<p>He secured them, then gently led the cavalry
mount over toward the crowd.</p>

<p>"Hurt much, Hal?" hailed Noll</p>

<p>"No; nothing worth talking about."</p>

<p>A soldier had said something about the woman
and the girl wishing to thank Corporal Hal,
but that man had spoken without looking, for
now the woman lay on the grass in a dead faint,
while the girl bent over her.</p>

<p>"Noll," spoke Corporal Overton, "at last accounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
I believe we were supposed to be standing
in front of Captain Cortland's tent, awaiting
his summons. I guess we'd better be hurrying
back to get on our job."</p>

<p>Noll led the horse at first. By and by Hal
reached over and secured the bridle, pausing
just an instant to stroke the animal's neck.</p>

<p>"You're a fine old fellow," Hal murmured,
gazing wistfully at the horse.</p>

<p>"Let's keep right on back," urged Noll. "Remember,
we're here really against orders."</p>

<p>Neither soldier boy thought of mounting the
animal for a ride back. No need existing, either
would have thought it a big piece of impudence
to mount an officer's horse unbidden.</p>

<p>Captain Cortland was standing before the
door of his tent, watching the approach of his
soldier boys. Beside Cortland stood another
officer, down the outer side of whose trousers'
legs ran the broad, yellow stripe of the cavalry.
This gentleman was Captain Ellis.</p>

<p>"We're in for it, I reckon," muttered Corporal
Hal to his chum as they drew nearer to
Cortland's tent. "Leaving when under orders,
and taking an officer's horse, at that. Well,
here's for our medicine!"</p>

<p>Both soldier boys stepped forward holding
themselves as erect as ever, just the same.</p>

<p>Then, halting before the captain's tent, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
came very formally to the salute.</p>

<p>"Captain Cortland, I am obliged to report,
sir, that I left here when under orders. I have
also to report that, seeing the danger of a serious
accident to others, I had the impudence to impress
an officer's horse. Unfortunately, sir,
that animal now appears to be injured."</p>

<p>"I have also, sir, to report leaving in the face
of other orders," Noll Terry stated gravely.</p>

<p>"In view of the reasons that lay behind your
acts," replied Captain Cortland, with only the
faintest twinkle of a smile, "I think we shall
have to conclude that discipline has not suffered
a serious affront this time."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, indeed, sir, that I rode
your fine animal to any injury," continued Corporal
Hal, turning and saluting the cavalry captain.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" scoffed Captain Ellis, stepping to
one side and surveying the cuts on his mount's
flank. "Nothing but a few scratches, Corporal&mdash;and
a whole horse is as nothing compared with
human lives. We got out in time to see your
handsome work, Corporal, and all I'm sorry for
is that we haven't you in the cavalry."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"You can't have these non-coms. of mine for
yellow-legs, Ellis," laughed Captain Cortland.
"You have just seen what a fine pair of young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
soldiers they are. I intend to keep them right
here in B Company."</p>

<p>"You always were a selfish fellow, Cortland,"
laughed Captain Ellis.</p>

<p>"You are hurt, are you not, Corporal?"
queried Captain Cortland, turning to Hal Overton.</p>

<p>"Nothing but a little scratch and a lump on
my head, sir. I had forgotten it until you
asked."</p>

<p>"Go over to hospital tent, Corporal Overton,
and have your head dressed. Corporal Terry,
you may go with your friend if you wish."</p>

<p>As the two young corporals saluted and
turned away, Captain Cortland stood gazing
after them for a few moments, while Private
Claxton walked the horse up and down.</p>

<p>"Ellis, you don't often find such a snappy, all-around
good pair of young soldiers, do you?"
asked B Company's commander.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," replied Captain Ellis.
"I have a few like them in my troop, I guess."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I'm from Missouri,"
laughed Captain Cortland.</p>

<p>We would gladly carry the present narrative
further, but here the present tale is obliged to
end, for there were no other developments of
an interesting nature while the encampment
with the Colorado National Guard continued.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
This period was filled with nothing beyond the
ordinary routine of camp instruction life, and
when it was all over Major Silsbee's battalion
of the Thirty-fourth gladly enough returned to
Fort Clowdry.</p>

<p>Our gallant soldier boys will be a little older
when next we meet them, as we shall do in the
next volume in this series, which will be published
under the title, "<span class="smcap">Uncle Sam's Boys as
Sergeants</span>; Or, Handling Their First Real
Commands." In this coming volume we shall
see to just what extent they made good as non-coms.,
and whether, in the broader sense, they
proved themselves the all-around soldiers that
their conduct up to date has seemed to assure.
In the next volume will be described much of
both the work and the play that fall to the regular
Army soldier's lot, and many rousing adventures
and ludicrous happenings will therein
be told.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
